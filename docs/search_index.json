"],["intro.html", "1 Introduction", " 1 Introduction In April of 2020, the Society for Ecosystem Restoration Northern British Columbia (SERNbc) undertook an initiative to plan and conduct fish passage restoration planning activities in the Bulkley River and Morice River watershed groups which are sub-basins of the Skeena River watershed. The initiative was supported by a grant from the Habitat Conservation Trust Fund that leveraged funds committed in the fall of 2019 from the Provincial Fish Passage Remediation Program and the Canadian Wildlife Federation. New Graph Environment and Hillcrest Geographics were the project team subcontracted to devise the study plan, submit proposals and complete the work which included information gathering, updating/implementation of open source data analysis tools, fish passage assessments and habitat confirmation assessments. Although fish passage restoration planning was conducted for both the Morice River watershed group and the Bulkley River watershed group, on the ground surveys in 2020 focused primarily within Bulkley River tributaries. In August of 2020, following a province wide prioritization exercise and a series of workshops, the Canadian Wildlife Federation selected the Bulkley River watershed group as a target watershed for connectivity planning efforts supported by a grant from the British Columbia Salmon Restoration and Innovation Fund. A Fish Passage Working Group consisting of First Nations, non-profits, stakeholder groups and regulators was established for the Bulkley River watershed group in the fall of 2020 as documented in Mazany-Wright et al. (2021). Recognizing synergies between the two initiatives, select project activities of both initiatives became a collaboration between SERNbc and CWF with extensive input from numerous organizations and individuals connected to the watersheds. This report builds on reporting from the spring of 2021 (Irvine 2021) which can be viewed interactively here. Please note that at the time of reporting, this document was a living document changing over time. Version numbers are logged for each release with modifications, enhancements and other changes tracked here with issues tracked here. The health and viability of freshwater fish populations can depend on access to tributary and off channel areas which provide refuge during high flows, opportunities for foraging, overwintering habitat, spawning habitat and summer rearing habitat (Bramblett et al. 2002; Swales and Levings 1989; Diebel et al. 2015). Culverts can present barriers to fish migration due to low water depth, increased water velocity, turbulence, a vertical drop at the culvert outlet and/or maintenance issues (Slaney, Zaldokas, and Watershed Restoration Program (B.C.) 1997; Cote et al. 2005). As road crossing structures are commonly upgraded or removed there are numerous opportunities to restore connectivity by ensuring that fish passage considerations are incorporated into repair, replacement, relocation and deactivation designs. Although remediation and replacement of stream crossing structures can have benefits to local fish populations, the costs of remedial works can be significant and the impacts of the work often complex to evaluate and quantify. Additionally, allocation of ecosystem restoration funding towards infrastructure upgrades on transportation right of ways are not always considered ethical under all circumstances from all perspectives. When funds are finite and invested groups are engaged in fund raising, cost benefits and the ethics of crossing replacements should be explored collaboratively alongside the cost benefits and ethics of alternative investment activities including transportation corridor relocation/deactivation, land procurement/covenant, cattle exclusion, riparian/floodplain restoration, habitat complexing, water conservation, commercial/recreational fishing management, salt water interventions and research.

The Wet’suwet’en people are a matrilineal society organized into the Gilseyhu (Big Frog), Laksilyu (Small Frog), Tsayu (Beaver clan), Gitdumden (Wolf/Bear) and Laksamshu (Fireweed) clans. Within each of the clans there are are a number of kin-based groups known as Yikhs or House groups. The Yikh is a partnership between the people and the territory. Thirteen Yikhs with Hereditary Chiefs manage a total of 38 distinct territories upon which they have jurisdiction. Within a clan, the head Chief is entrusted with the stewardship of the House territory to ensure the Land is managed in a sustainable manner. Inuk Nu’at’en (Wet’suwet’en law) governing the harvesting of fish within their lands are based on values founded on thousands of years of social, subsistence and environmental dynamics. The Yintahk (Land) is the centre of life as well as culture and it’s management is intended to provide security for sustaining salmon, wildlife, and natural foods to ensure the health and well-being of the Wet’suwet’en (Office of the Wet’suwet’en 2013; “Office of the Wet’suwet’en” 2021; FLNRORD 2017). 2.2 Gitxsan The Gitxsan Laxyip (traditional territories) covers an area of 33,000km2 within the Skeena River and Nass River watersheds. The Laxyip is governed by 60 Simgiigyet (Hereditary Chiefs), within the traditional hereditary system made up of Wilps (House groups). Anaat are fisheries tenures found throughout the Laxyip. Traditional governance within a matrilineal society operates under the principles of Ayookw (Gitxsan law) (“Gitxsan Huwilp Government” 2021). # Salmon is considered the source of life and always treated with high regard. It was brought by the Raven who also taught people how to fish and hunt. 2.3 Project Location knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/BulkelyMoriceOverview2.jpeg&quot;) Figure 2.1: Overview map of Study Areas 2.3.1 Bulkley River The Bukley River is an 8th order stream that drains an area of 7,762 km2 in a generally northerly direction from Bulkley Lake on the Nechako Plateau to its confluence with the Skeena River at Hazleton. It has a mean annual discharge of 138.7 m3/s at station 08EE004 located near Quick (~27km south of Telkwa) and 18.8 m3/s at station 08EE003 located upstream near Houston. Flow patterns at Quick are heavily influenced by inflows from the Morice River (enters just downstream of Houston) resulting in flow patterns typical of high elevation watersheds which receive large amounts of precipitation as snow leading to peak levels of discharge during snowmelt, typically from May to July (Figures 2.2 - 2.3). The hydrograph peaks faster and generally earlier (May - June) for the Bulkley River upstream of Houston where the topography is of lower lower elevation (Figures 2.2 and 2.4). Changes to the climate systems are causing impacts to natural and human systems on all continents with alterations to hydrological systems caused by changing precipitation or melting snow and ice increasing the frequency and magnitude of extreme events such as floods and droughts (IPCC 2014; ECCC 2016). These changes are resulting in modifications to the quantity and quality of water resources throughout British Columbia and are likely to compound issues related to drought and flooding in the Bulkley River watershed where numerous water licenses are held with a potential over-allocation of flows identified during low flow periods (ILMB 2007). The valley bottom has seen extensive settlement over the past hundred years with major population centers including the Village of Hazelton, the Town of Smithers, the Village of Telkwa and the District Municipality of Houston. As a major access corridor to northwestern British Columbia, Highway 16 and the Canadian National Railway are major linear developments that run along the Bulkley River within and adjacent to the floodplain with numerous crossing structures impeding fish access into and potentially out from important fish habitats. Additionally, as the valley bottom contains some of the most productive land in the area, there has been extensive conversion of riparian ecosystems to hayfields and pastures leading to alterations in flow regimes, increases in water temperatures, reduced streambank stability, loss of overstream cover and channelization (ILMB 2007; Wilson and Rabnett 2007). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08EE004.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/pixel.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08EE003.png&quot;) Figure 2.2: Hydrograph for Bulkley River at Quick (Station #08EE004) and near Houston (Station #08EE003). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrology_stats_08EE004.png&quot;) Figure 2.3: Summary of hydrology statistics for Bulkley River at Quick (Station #08EE004 - daily discharge data from 1930 to 2018). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrology_stats_08EE003.png&quot;) Figure 2.4: Summary of hydrology statistics for Bulkley River near Houston (Station #08EE003 - daily discharge data from 1980 to 2018). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrology_stats_08EE004.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/pixel.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrology_stats_08EE003.png&quot;) 2.3.2 Morice River The Morice River watershed drains 4,379 km2 of Coast Mountains and Interior Plateau in a generally south-eastern direction. The Morice River is an 8th order stream that flows approximately 80km from Morice Lake to the confluence with the upper Bulkley River just north of Houston. Major tributaries include the Nanika River, the Atna River, Gosnell Creek and the Thautil River. There area numerous large lakes situated on the south side of the watershed including Morice Lake, McBride Lake, Stepp Lake, Nanika Lake, Kid Price Lake, Owen Lake and others. There is one active hydrometric station on the mainstem of the Morice River near the outlet of Morice Lake and one historic station that was located at the mouth of the river near Houston that gathered data in 1971 only (Environment and limate Change Canada 2021). An estimate of mean annual discharge for the one year of data available for the Morice near it’s confluence with the Bulkley River is 113.3 m3/s. Mean annual discharge is estimated at 75.3 m3/s at station 08ED002 located near the outlet of Morice Lake. Flow patterns are typical of high elevation watersheds influenced by coastal weather patterns which receive large amounts of winter precipitation as snow in the winter and large precipitation events in the fall. This leads to peak levels of discharge during snowmelt, typically from May to July with isolated high flows related to rain and rain on snow events common in the fall (Figures 2.5 - 2.6). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08ED003.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/pixel.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08ED002.png&quot;) Figure 2.5: Left: Hydrograph for Morice River near Houston (Station #08ED003 - 1971 data only).

Available daily discharge data from 1961 to 2018. 2.4 Fisheries In 2004, IBM Business Consulting Services (2006) estimated the value of Skeena Fisheries at an annual average of $110 million dollars. The Bulkley-Morice watershed is an integral part of the salmon production in the Skeena drainage and supports an internationally renown steelhead, chinook and coho sport fishery (G. C. Tamblyn 2005). 2.4.1 Bulkley River Traditionally, the salmon stocks passing through and spawning in Bulkley River were the principal food source for the Gitxsan and Wet’suwet’en people living there (Wilson and Rabnett 2007). Wilson and Rabnett (2007) detail numerous fishing areas located within the lower Bulkley drainage (from the confluence of the Skeena to the confluence with the Telkwa River) and the upper Bulkley drainage which includes the mainstem Bulkley River and tributaries upstream of the Telkwa River confluence. Anadromous lamprey passing through and spawning in the upper Bulkley River were traditionally also an important food source for the Wet’suwet’en (Wilson and Rabnett 2007; pers comm. Mike Ridsdale, Environmental Assessment Coordinator, Office of the Wet’suwet’en). Approximately 11.3 km downstream of the Bulkley Lake outlet and just upstream of Watson Creek, the upper Bulkley falls is an approximately 4m high narrow rock sill that crosses the Bulkley River, producing a steep cascade section. This obstacle to fish passage is recorded as an almost complete barrier to fish passage for salmon during low water flows. Coho have not been observed beyond the falls since 1972 (Wilson and Rabnett 2007). Renowned as a world class recreational steelhead and coho fishery, the Bulkley River receives some of the heaviest angling pressure in the province. In response to longstanding angler concerns with respect to overcrowding, quality of experience and conflict amongst anglers, an Angling Management Plan was drafted for the river following the initiation of the Skeena Quality Waters Strategy process in 2006 and an extensive multi-year consultation process. The plan introduces a number of regulatory measures with the intent to provide Canadian resident anglers with quality steelhead fishing opportunities. Regulatory measures introduced with the Angling Management Plan include prohibited angling for non-guided non-resident aliens on Saturdays and Sundays, Sept 1 - Oct 31 within the Bulkley River, angling prohibited for non-guided non-resident aliens on Saturdays and Sundays, all year within the Suskwa River and angling prohibited for non-guided non-resident aliens Sept 1 - Oct 31 in the Telkwa River. The Bukley River is considered Class II waterand there is no fshing permitted upstream of the Morice/Bulkley River Confluence (FLNRO 2013a, 2013b; FLNRORD 2019). 2.4.2 Morice River Detailed reviews of Morice River watershed fisheries can be found in Bustard and Schell (2002), Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall (2002), Schell (2003), A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett (2007), and ILMB (2007) with a comprehensive review of water quality by Oliver (2018). Overall, the Morice watershed contains high fisheries values as a major producer of chinook, pink, sockeye, coho and steelhead. 2.4.2.1 Fish Species Fish species recorded in the Bulkley River and Morice River watershed groups are detailed in Table 2.1 (MoE 2020a). Coastal cutthrout trout and bull trout are considered of special concern (blue-listed) provincially. Summaries of some of the Skeena and Bulkley River fish species life history, biology, stock status, and traditional use are documented in Schell (2003), Wilson and Rabnett (2007), Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall (2002) and Office of the Wet’suwet’en (2013). Wilson and Rabnett (2007) discuss chinook, pink, sockeye, coho, steelhead and indigenous freshwater Bulkley River fish stocks within the context of key lower and upper Bulkley River habitats such as the Suskwa River, Station Creek, Harold Price Creek, Telkwa River and Buck Creek. Key areas within the upper Bulkley River watershed with high fishery values, documented in Schell (2003), are the upper Bulkley mainstem, Buck Creek, Dungate Creek, Barren Creek, McQuarrie Creek, Byman Creek, Richfield Creek, Johnny David Creek, Aitken Creek and Emerson Creek. Some key areas of high fisheries values for chinook, sockeye and coho are noted in Bustard and Schell (2002) as McBride Lake, Nanika Lake, and Morice Lake watersheds. A draft gantt chart for select species in the Morice River and Bulkley River watersheds was derived from reviews of the aforementioned references and is included as Figure 2.7. The data is considered in draft form and will be refined over the spring and summer of 2021 with local fisheries technicians and knowledge holders during the collaboratory assessment planning and fieldwork activities planned. In the 1990’s the Morice River watershed, A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett (2007) estimated that chinook comprised 30% of the total Skeena system chinook escapements. It is estimated that Morice River coho comprise approximatley 4% of the Skeena escapement with a declining trend noted since the 1950 in A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett (2007). Coho spawn in major tributaries and small streams ideally at locations where downstream dispersal can result in seeding of prime off channel habitats including warm productive sloughs and side channels. Of all the salmon species, coho rely on small tributaries the most (Bustard and Schell 2002). Bustard and Schell (2002) report that much of the distribution of coho into non-natal tributaries occurs during high flow periods of May - early July with road culverts blocking migration into these habitats. ##### Chinook # In the 1990&#39;s Morice River watershed, @gottesfeld_rabnett2007SkeenaFish estimated that chinook comprised 30% of the total Skeena system chinook escapements. @buckwalter_kirsch2012Fishinventory have recorded juvenile chinook rearing in small non natal streams. # @buckwalter_kirsch2012Fishinventory have uvenile chinook have been recorded rearing in small non natal streams #It is estimated that Morice River coho comprise approximatley 4% of the Skeena escapement with a declining trend noted since the 1950 in @gottesfeld_rabnett2007SkeenaFish.

A Fish Passage Technical Working Group has been formed to coordinate the protocol and data is continuously amalgamated within the Provincial Steam Crossing Inventory System (PSCIS). The strategic approach protocol involves a four-phase process as described in Fish Passage Technical Working Group (2014) : Phase 1: Fish Passage Assessment – Fish stream crossings within watersheds with high fish values are assessed to determine barrier status of structures and document a general assessment of adjacent habitat quality and quantity. Phase 2: Habitat Confirmation – Assessments of crossings prioritized for follow up in Phase 1 studies are conducted to confirm quality and quantity of habitat upstream and down as well as to scope for other potential nearby barriers that could affect the practicality of remediation. Phase 3: Design – Site plans and designs are drawn for priority crossings where high value fish habitat has been confirmed. Phase 4: Remediation – Re-connection of isolated habitats through replacement, rehabilitation or removal of prioritized crossing structure barriers. 2.5.1 Bulkley River There is a rich history of fish passage restoration planning in the Bulkley River watershed group with not all the work documented in the PSCIS system. A non-exhaustive list of historic fish passage reports for the watershed includes Wilson and Rabnett (2007), McCarthy and Fernando (2015),Smith (2018) Casselman and Stanley (2010) and Irvine (2018). Review of the PSCIS database indicated that prior to 2021, 1665 assessments for fish passage (Phase 1) at crossing structures within the Bulkley River watershed group have been recorded in the PSCIS database (MoE 2021a). No habitat confirmations are recorded in the PSCIS database (MoE 2021b). Within the Bulkley River watershed group, a number of remediation projects have been completed over the years with backwatering works conducted on Toboggan Creek, Coffin Creek, Moan Creek, Johnny David Creek and potentially others. Three culvert replacements (with open bottom structures) in the watershed group have been tracked in PSCIS and include works on Barren Creek as well as two tributaries to Harold Prince Creek (MoE 2021c). McDowell Creek at Highway 16 was replaced with a horizontally drilled baffled structure in 2017 and a design is currently being drafted for the Highway 16 crossing over Taman Creek (pers. comm.

All components leveraged R, SQL or Python programming languages to facilitate workflow tracking, collaboration, transparency and continually improving research.

Scripts within bcfishpass also pull and analyze data using other open-source tools such as bcdata (Norris 2021b), bcfishobs (Norris 2021c), and fwapg (Norris 2021a) which serve numerous functions related to open-data access as well as the analysis of the BC Freshwater Atlas, roads, fish and fish habitat in British Columbia. 3.1.1 Habitat Modelling bcfishpass calculates the average gradient of BC Freshwater Atlas stream network lines at minimum 100m long intervals starting from the downstream end of the streamline segment and working upstream. The network lines are broken into max gradient categories with new segments created if and when the average slope of the stream line segment exceeds user provided thresholds. For this project, the user provided gradient thresholds used to delineate “potentially accessible habitat” were based on estimated max gradients that salmon (15% - coho and chinook) and steelhead (20%) are likely to be capable of ascending. Through this initiative and other SERN/New Graph led initiatives, the Provincial Fish Passage Remediation Program and connectivity restoration planning (Mazany-Wright et al. 2021), bcfishpass has been designed to prioritize potential fish passage barriers for assessment or remediation. The software is under continual development and has been designed and constructed by Norris (2021d) using of sql and python based shell script libraries to generate a simple model of aquatic habitat connectivity. The model identifes natural barriers (ex. steep gradients for extended distances) and hydroelectric dams to classifying the accessibility upstream by fish (Norris 2021d). On potentially accessible streams, scripts identify known barriers (ex. waterfalls &gt;5m high) and additional anthropogenic features which are primarily road/railway stream crossings (i.e. culverts) that are potentially barriers. To prioritize these features for assessment or remediation, scripts report on how much modelled potentially accessible aquatic habitat the barriers may obstruct. The model can be refined with known fish observations upstream of identified barriers and for each crossing location, the area of lake and wetland habitat upstream, species documented upstream/downstream, an estimate of watershed area (on 2nd order and higher streams), mean annual precipitation weighted to upstream watershed area and channel width can be collated using bcfishpass, fwapg and bcfishobs. This, information, can be used to provides an indication of the potential quantity and quality of habitat potentially gained should fish passage be restored by comparing to user defined thresholds for the aforementioned parameters. A discussion of the methodology to derive channel width is below. Gradient, channel size and stream discharge are key determinants of channel morphology and subsequently fish distribution. High value rearing, overwintering and spawning habitat preferred by numerous species/life stages of fish are often located within channel types that have relatively low gradients and large channel widths (also quantified by the amount of flow in the stream). Following delineation of “potentially accessible habitat”, the average gradient of each stream segment within habitat classified as below the 15% and 20% thresholds was calculated and summed within species and life stage specific gradient categories. Average gradient of stream line segments can be calculated from elevations contained in the provincial freshwater atlas streamline dataset. To obtain estimates of channel width upstream of crossing locations, Where available, bcfishpass was utilized to pull average channel gradients from Fisheries Information Summary System (FISS) site assessment data (MoE 2020e) or PSCIS assessment data (MoE 2021a) and associate with stream segment lines. When both FISS and PSCIS values were associated with a particular stream segment, FISS channel width was used. When multiple FISS sites were associated with a particular stream segment a mean of the average channel widths was taken. To model channel width for 2nd order and above stream segments without associated FISS or PSCIS sites, first fwapg was used to estimate the drainage area upstream of the segment. Then, rasters from ClimateBC (Wang et al. 2012) were sampled for each stream segments and a mean annual precipitation weighted by upstream watershed area was calculated. Mean annual precipitation was then combined with the channel widths and BEC zone information (gathered through a spatial query tied to the bottom of the stream segment) into a dataset (n = 22990) for analysis fo the relationship between these variables. The details of this analysis and resulting formula used to estimate channel width on stream segments in the Bukley River and Morice River watersheds is included as a technical appendix here. bcfishpass and associated tools have been designed to be flexible in analysis, accepting user defined gradient, channel width and stream discharge categories (MoE 2020e). Although currently in draft form, and subject to development revisions, gradient and channel width thresholds for habitat with the highest intrinsic value for a number of fish species in the Bulkley River and Morice River watersheds groups have been specified and applied to model habitat upstream of stream crossing locations with the highest intrinsic value (Table 3.1). Thresholds were derived based on a literature review with references provided in Table 3.2. Output parameters for modelling are presented in Table 3.3. #`r if(identical(gitbook_on, FALSE)){knitr::asis_output(&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;)}` bcfishpass_spawn_rear_model %&gt;% mutate(Species = fishbc::fbc_common_name(species_code), spawn_gradient_max = round(spawn_gradient_max * 100 ,1), rear_gradient_max = round(rear_gradient_max * 100 ,1)) %&gt;% select(Species, `Spawning Gradient Max (%)`= spawn_gradient_max, `Spawning Width Min (m)` = spawn_channel_width_min, # `Spawning Width Max (m)` = spawn_channel_width_max, # `Spawning MAD Min (m3/s)` = spawn_mad_min, # `Spawning MAD Max (m3/s)` = spawn_mad_max, `Rearing Gradient Max (%)` = rear_gradient_max) %&gt;% # `Rearing MAD Min (m3/s)` = rear_mad_min, # `Rearing MAD Max (m3/s)` = rear_mad_max, # `Rearing Wetland Multiplier` = rear_wetland_multiplier, # `Rearing Lake Multiplier` = rear_lake_multiplier) %&gt;% t() %&gt;% as_tibble(rownames = &quot;row_names&quot;) %&gt;% janitor::row_to_names(row_number = 1) %&gt;% rename(Variable = Species) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Stream gradient and channel width thresholds used to model potentially highest value fish habitat.&#39;, scroll = F) Table 3.1: Stream gradient and channel width thresholds used to model potentially highest value fish habitat.

To determine which of those crossings had not yet been assessed with Phase 1 and Phase 2 assessments we cross-referenced these reports with the PSCIS database, available background info and viewed sites within the output of bcfishpass. Outputs for modelled and PSCIS crossings (barriers and potential barriers) that met the following criteria underwent a detailed review to facilitate prioritization for Phase1 - Fish Passage Assessments and Phase 2 - Habitat Confirmations. Confirmed fish presence upstream of the structure. Stream width documented as &gt; 2.0m in PSCIS. Linear lengths of modelled upstream habitat &lt;8% gradient for ≥1km. Crossings located on streams classified as 3rd order or higher. Crossings located on streams with &gt;5 ha of modeled wetland and/or lake habitat upstream. Habitat value rated as “medium” or “high” in PSCIS. Additionally, bcfishpass outputs and working group discussions were utilized as described in Mazany-Wright et al. (2021) to provide candidate crossings for field review in the Bulkley River watershed group. 3.2 Fish Passage Assessments In the field, crossings prioritized for follow-up were first assessed for fish passage following the procedures outlined in “Field Assessment for Determining Fish Passage Status of Closed Bottomed Structures” (MoE 2011a). Crossings surveyed included closed bottom structures (CBS), open bottom structures (OBS) and crossings considered “other” (i.e. fords). Photos were taken at surveyed crossings and when possible included images of the road, crossing inlet, crossing outlet, crossing barrel, channel downstream and channel upstream of the crossing and any other relevant features. The following information was recorded for all surveyed crossings: date of inspection, crossing reference, crew member initials, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, stream name, road name and kilometer, road tenure information, crossing type, crossing subtype, culvert diameter or span for OBS, culvert length or width for OBS. A more detailed “full assessment” was completed for all closed bottom structures and included the following parameters: presence/absence of continuous culvert embedment (yes/no), average depth of embedment, whether or not the culvert bed resembled the native stream bed, presence of and percentage backwatering, fill depth, outlet drop, outlet pool depth, inlet drop, culvert slope, average downstream channel width, stream slope, presence/absence of beaver activity, presence/absence of fish at time of survey, type of valley fill, and a habitat value rating. Habitat value ratings were based on channel morphology, flow characteristics (perennial, intermittent, ephemeral), fish migration patterns, the presence/absence of deep pools, un-embedded boulders, substrate, woody debris, undercut banks, aquatic vegetation and overhanging riparian vegetation (Table 3.4). For crossings determined to be potential barriers or barriers based on the data (see Barrier Scoring), a culvert fix and recommended diameter/span was proposed. tab_habvalue %&gt;% knitr::kable(caption = &#39;Habitat value criteria (Fish Passage Technical Working Group, 2011).&#39;, booktabs = T) %&gt;% kableExtra::column_spec(column = 1, width_min = &#39;1.5in&#39;) %&gt;% kableExtra::kable_styling(c(&quot;condensed&quot;), full_width = T, font_size = font_set) Table 3.4: Table 3.5: Habitat value criteria (Fish Passage Technical Working Group, 2011). Habitat Value Fish Habitat Criteria High The presence of high value spawning or rearing habitat (e.g., locations with abundance of suitably sized gravels, deep pools, undercut banks, or stable debris) which are critical to the fish population. Medium Important migration corridor. Presence of suitable spawning habitat. Habitat with moderate rearing potential for the fish species present. Low No suitable spawning habitat, and habitat with low rearing potential (e.g., locations without deep pools, undercut banks, or stable debris, and with little or no suitably sized spawning gravels for the fish species present). 3.2.1 Barrier Scoring Fish passage potential was determined for each stream crossing identified as a closed bottom structure as per MoE (2011a). The combined scores from five criteria: depth and degree to which the structure is embedded, outlet drop, stream width ratio, culvert slope, and culvert length were used to screen whether each culvert was a likely barrier to some fish species and life stages (Table 3.6, Table 3.7. These criteria were developed based on data obtained from various studies and reflect an estimation for the passage of a juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout (Clarkin et al. 2005; Bell 1991; Thompson 2013). tab &lt;- as_tibble(t(tab_barrier_scoring)) %&gt;% mutate(V4 = names(tab_barrier_scoring)) %&gt;% select(V4, everything()) %&gt;% janitor::row_to_names(1) %&gt;% ##turn the table sideways mutate(Risk = case_when(Risk == &#39;Value&#39; ~ &#39; Value&#39;, T ~ Risk)) tab %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Fish Barrier Risk Assessment (MoE 2011).&#39;, scroll = F) Table 3.6: Fish Barrier Risk Assessment (MoE 2011).

For this project, a gradient threshold between accessible and non-accessible habitat was set at 20% (for a minimimum length of 100m) intended to represent the maximum gradient of which the strongest swimmers of anadromous species (steelhead) are likely to be able to migrate upstream. For reporting of Phase 1 - fish passage assessments within the body of this report (Table 3.6), a “total” value of habitat &lt;20% output from bcfishpass was used to estimate the amount of habitat upstream of each crossing less than 20% gradient before a falls of height &gt;5m - as recorded in MoE (2020c) or documented in other bcfishpass online documentation. For Phase 2 - habitat confirmation sites, conservative estimates of the linear quantity of habitat to be potentially gained by fish passage restoration, steelhead rearing maximum gradient threshold (7.4%) was used. To generate areas of habitat upstream, the estimated linear length was multiplied by half the downstream channel width measured (overall triangular channel shape) as part of the fish passage assessment protocol. Although these estimates are not generally conservative, have low accuracy and do not account for upstream stream crossing structures they allow a rough idea of the best candidates for follow up. Potential options to remediate fish passage were selected from MoE (2011a) and included: Removal (RM) - Complete removal of the structure and deactivation of the road. Open Bottom Structure (OBS) - Replacement of the culvert with a bridge or other open bottom structure. Based on consultation with FLNR road crossing engineering experts, for this project we considered bridges as the only viable option for OBS type . Streambed Simulation (SS) - Replacement of the structure with a streambed simulation design culvert. Often achieved by embedding the culvert by 40% or more. Based on consultation with FLNR engineering experts, we considered crossings on streams with a channel width of &lt;2m and a stream gradient of &lt;8% as candidates for replacement with streambed simulations. Additional Substrate Material (EM) - Add additional substrate to the culvert and/or downstream weir to embed culvert and reduce overall velocity/turbulence. This option was considered only when outlet drop = 0, culvert slope &lt;1.0% and stream width ratio &lt; 1.0. Backwater (BW) - Backwatering of the structure to reduce velocity and turbulence. This option was considered only when outlet drop &lt; 0.3m, culvert slope &lt;2.0%, stream width ratio &lt; 1.2 and stream profiling indicates it would be effective.. Cost estimates for structure replacement with bridges and embedded culverts were generated based on the channel width, slope of the culvert, depth of fill, road class and road surface type. Road details were sourced from FLNRORD (2020b) and FLNRORD (2020a) through bcfishpass. Interviews with Phil MacDonald, Engineering Specialist FLNR - Kootenay, Steve Page, Area Engineer - FLNR - Northern Engineering Group and Matt Hawkins - MoTi - Design Supervisor for Highway Design and Survey - Nelson were utilized to helped refine estimates. Base costs for installation of bridges on forest service roads and permit roads with surfaces specified in provincial GIS road layers as rough and loose was estimated at $12500/linear m and assumed that the road could be closed during construction and a minimum bridge span of 10m. For streams with channel widths &lt;2m, embedded culverts were reported as an effective solution with total installation costs estimated at $25k/crossing (pers. comm. Phil MacDonald, Steve Page). For larger streams (&gt;6m), span width increased proportionally to the size of the stream (ex. for an 8m wide stream a 12m wide span was prescribed). For crossings with large amounts of fill (&gt;3m), the replacement bridge span was increased by an additional 3m for each 1m of fill &gt;3m to account for cutslopes to the stream at a 1.5:1 ratio. To account for road type, a multiplier table was also generated to estimate incremental cost increases with costs estimated for structure replacement on paved surfaces, railways and arterial/highways costing up to 20 times more than forest service roads due to expenses associate with design/engineering requirements, traffic control and paving. The cost multiplier table (Table 3.8) should be considered very approximate with refinement recommended for future projects. # print_tab_cost_mult(caption_text = &#39;Cost multiplier table based on road class and surface type.&#39;) tab_cost_rd_mult_report %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Cost multiplier table based on road class and surface type.&#39;, scroll = F) Table 3.8: Cost multiplier table based on road class and surface type.

The main objective of the field surveys was to document upstream habitat quantity and quality and to determine if any other obstructions exist above or below the crossing. Habitat value was assessed based on channel morphology, flow characteristics (perennial, intermittent, ephemeral), the presence/absence of deep pools, un-embedded boulders, substrate, woody debris, undercut banks, aquatic vegetation and overhanging riparian vegetation. Criteria used to rank habitat value was based on guidelines in Fish Passage Technical Working Group (2011) (Table 3.4). During habitat confirmations, to standardize data collected and facilitate submission of the data to provincial databases, information was collated on “Site Cards”. Habitat characteristics recorded included channel widths, wetted widths, residual pool depths, gradients, bankfull depths, stage, temperature, conductivity, pH, cover by type, substrate and channel morphology (among others). When possible, the crew surveyed downstream of the crossing to the point where fish presence had been previously confirmed and upstream to a minimum distance of 600m. Any potential obstacles to fish passage were inventoried with photos, physical descriptions and locations recorded on site cards. Surveyed routes were recorded with time-signatures on handheld GPS units. Fish sampling was conducted a subset of sites when biological data was considered to add significant value to the physical habitat assessment information. When possible, electrofishing was utilized within discrete site units both upstream and downstream of the subject crossing with electrofisher settings, water quality parameters (i.e. conductivity, temperature and ph), start location, length of site and wetted widths (average of a minimum of three) recorded. For each fish captured, fork length and species was recorded, with results included within the fish data submission spreadsheet. Fish information and habitat data will be submitted to the province under scientific fish collection permit CB20-611971. 3.4 Reporting Reporting was generated with bookdown (Xie 2016) from Rmarkdown (Allaire et al. 2024) with primarily R (R Core Team 2022) and SQL scripts. The R package fpr contains many specialized custom functions related to the work (Irvine [2022] 2022). In addition to numerous spatial layers sourced through the BC Data Catalogue then stored and queried in a local postgresql and sqlite databases data inputs for this project include: Populated Fish Data Submission Spreadsheet Template - V 2.0, January 20, 2020 Populated pscis_assessment_template_v24.xls bcfishpass outputs.

Photos and photo metadata Version changes are tracked here and issues/planned enhancements tracked here. 3.5 Mapping Mapping was completed by Hillcrest Geographics. pdf maps were generated using QGIS with data supplied via a postgreSQL database. A QGIS layer file defining and symbolizing all layers required for general fish passage mapping was developed and at the time of reporting was kept under version control within bcfishpass.

A total of 191 Phase 1 assessments were conducted with 77 crossings considered “passable”, 10 crossings considered “potential” barriers and 84 crossings considered “barriers” according to threshold values based on culvert embedment, outlet drop, slope, diameter (relative to channel size) and length (MoE 2011a). Additionally, although all were considered fully passable, 20 crossings assessed were fords and ranked as “unknown” according to the provincial protocol. Georeferenced field maps are presented here and available for bulk download as Attachment 1. A summary of crossings assessed, a cost benefit analysis and priority ranking for follow up for Phase 1 sites presented in Table 4.1. Detailed data with photos are presented in Appendix - Phase 1 Fish Passage Assessment Data and Photos. “Barrier” and “Potential Barrier” rankings used in this project followed MoE (2011a) and reflect an assessment of passability for juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout at any flows potentially present throughout the year (Clarkin et al. 2005; Bell 1991; Thompson 2013). As noted in Bourne et al. (2011), with a detailed review of different criteria in Kemp and O’Hanley (2010), passability of barriers can be quantified in many different ways. Fish physiology (i.e. species, length, swim speeds) can make defining passability complex but with important implications for evaluating connectivity and prioritizing remediation candidates (Bourne et al. 2011; Shaw et al. 2016; Mahlum et al. 2014; Kemp and O’Hanley 2010). Washington Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife (2009) present criteria for assigning passability scores to culverts that have already been assessed as barriers in coarser level assessments. These passability scores provide additional information to feed into decision making processes related to the prioritization of remediation site candidates and have potential for application in British Columbia. #`r if(identical(gitbook_on, FALSE)){knitr::asis_output(&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;)}` # if(gitbook_on){ # tab_cost_est_phase1 %&gt;% # fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Upstream habitat estimates and cost benefit analysis for Phase 1 assessments.&#39;, scroll = gitbook_on) # } else tab_cost_est_phase1 %&gt;% # fpr::fpr_kable(scroll = F, caption_text = &#39;Upstream habitat estimates and cost benefit analysis for Phase 1 assessments.&#39;) tab_cost_est_phase1 %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Upstream habitat estimates and cost benefit analysis for Phase 1 assessments.

located near Topley, BC on the mainstem of the Bulkley River. Information on the crossing was scarce so an assessment was prioritized by Canadian Wildlife Federation. The site was assessed on October 28, 2021 by Nallas Nikal, B.i.T, and Chad Lewis, Environmental Technician. The top of the falls is located at 11U.678269.6038266 at an elevation of 697m approximatley 11.3km downstream of Bulkley Lake and upstream of Ailport Creek (Figures 4.2 - 4.3).. Water temperature was 3.0\\(^\\circ\\)C, pH was 7.75 and conductivity was 159uS/cm. Within the Bulkley River immediately below the 12 - 15m high bedrock falls, channel width was 17.4m and the wetted width was 15.6m. Two channels comprised the falls. The primary channel was 20m long, had a channel/wetted width of 8.5m, a 16% grade and water depths ranging from 35 - 63cm. The secondary channel was 25m long, with channel/wetted widths of 7.5m, a grade of 12% and water depths ranging from 3 - 13cm. Dyson (1949) and Stokes (1956) report substantial use of habitat above Bulkley Falls by steelhead, chinook, coho and sockeye utilization in the past (pre-1950) based on spawning reports. Both authors concluded that the Bulkley Falls pose a partial obstruction to migrating fish based on flow levels. Chinook, which migrate early in the summer when water levels are high, have been noted as able to ascend the falls in normal to high water years and in high water years it was thought that coho and steelhead could ascend. A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett (2007) report that the falls are almost completely impassable to all salmon during low water flows. Stokes (1956) reports that there was high value spawning habitat located within the first 3km of the Bulkley River from the outlet of Bulkley Lake. my_photo1 = fpr::fpr_photo_pull_by_str(site = &#39;bulkley_falls&#39;, str_to_pull = &#39;_u1_&#39;) my_caption1 = paste0(&#39;Bulkley Falls main channel.&#39;) # fpr::fpr_photo_flip(site_id = 1802488, str_to_pull = &#39;6257&#39;) knitr::include_graphics(my_photo1) Figure 4.2: Bulkley Falls main channel. # grid::grid.raster(jpeg::readJPEG(my_photo1)) my_photo2 = fpr::fpr_photo_pull_by_str(site = &#39;bulkley_falls&#39;, str_to_pull = &#39;_u2_&#39;) my_caption2 = paste0(&#39;Bulkley Falls side channel.&#39;) knitr::include_graphics(my_photo2) Figure 4.3: Bulkley Falls side channel. my_caption &lt;- paste0(&#39;Left: &#39;, my_caption1, &#39; Right: &#39;, my_caption2) knitr::include_graphics(my_photo1) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/pixel.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(my_photo2) 4.3 Phase 2 During 2021 field assessments, habitat confirmation assessments were conducted at 29 sites in the Bulkley River and Morice River watershed groups. A total of approximately 25km of stream was assessed, fish sampling utilizing electrofishing was conducted at five sites, and five sites were mapped using remotely piloted aircraft. Georeferenced field maps are presented in here and available for bulk download as Attachment 1. As collaborative decision making was ongoing at the time of reporting, site prioritization can be considered preliminary. In total, Twelve crossings were rated as high priorities for proceeding to design for replacement, 11 crossings were rated as moderate priorities, and 6 crossings were rated as low priorities. Results are summarized in Figure 4.1 and Tables 4.2 - 4.6 with raw habitat and fish sampling data included in digital format as Attachment 3. A summary of preliminary modelling results illustrating the quantity of chinook, coho and steelhead spawning and rearing habitat potentially available upstream of each crossing as estimated by measured/modelled channel width and upstream accessible stream length are presented in Figure 4.4. Detailed information for each site assessed with Phase 2 assessments (including maps) are presented within site specific appendices to this document. #`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output(&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;)} else knitr::asis_output(&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;)` # if(gitbook_on){ # tab_overview %&gt;% # select(-Tenure) %&gt;% # fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Overview of habitat confirmation sites.&#39;) # } else tab_overview %&gt;% # select(-Tenure) %&gt;% # fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Overview of habitat confirmation sites.&#39;, scroll = F) tab_overview %&gt;% select(-Tenure) %&gt;% table_phase2_overview(caption_text = &#39;Overview of habitat confirmation sites.

Designs for McDowell and Robert Hatch were procured by SERNbc and Canadian Wildlife Federation respectively. At the time of reporting, the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure was in the process of procuring designs for remediation of fish passage at three sites documented in Irvine (2021) including PSCIS 123445 on Tyhee Creek, PSCIS 124500 on Helps Creek and PSCIS 197640 on a tributary to Buck Creek. Additionally, the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure were procuring a design for PSCIS crossing 124420 on Mission Creek (a.k.a Station Creek) in Hazleton (pers. comm. Sean Wong, Environmental Programs, MoTi). Details for the habitat confirmation of Mission Creek are included in the associated appendix of this report. 4.5 Phase 4 Ministry of Forest engineers collaborated with Canfor and Coastal Gaslink to replace crossing 197962 on Peacock Creek located on the Morice FSR within the Morice River watershed group. As detailed in the associated attachment within this report, baseline effectiveness monitoring including multipass electrofishing at three closed sites both upstream and downstream of the FSR in the fall of 2021 before the bridge install occurred. "],["recommendations.html", "5 Recommendations", " 5 Recommendations Recommendations for potential incorporation into collaborative watershed connectivity planning include: Continue to acquire background information and leverage ongoing research initiatives in the region to collaboratively clarify current conditions and identify limiting factors to inform prioritization and effectiveness monitoring programs. Develop strategies to explore cost and fisheries production benefits of stream crossing structure upgrades alongside alternative/additional restoration and enhancement investments such as land conservation/procurement/covenant, cattle exclusion, riparian restoration, habitat complexing, water conservation, commercial/recreational fishing management, water treatment and research. Ideentify and pursue opportunities to collaborate and leverage initiatives together in study area watersheds (ex. fish passage rehabilitation, riparian restoration and cattle exclusion) for maximum likely restoration benefits. Refine barrier thresholds for road-stream crossing structures to explore metrics specific to life stage and life history types of species of interest. This will further focus efforts of potential remediation actions based on biological attributes (ex. timing of migration, size/direction of fish migrating, population dynamics, etc.) and could result in the consideration of interim “stop-gap” physical works to alter crossing characteristics that can address key connectivity issues yet be significantly less costly than structure replacements (ex. building up of downstream area with rock riffles to decrease the outlet drop size and/or increasing water depth within pipe with baffles and substrate additions). Model fish densities (fish/m2) vs. habitat/water quality characteristics (i.e. gradient, discharge, alkalinity, elevation, riparian health, distance from high order streams, etc.) using historically gathered electrofishing and remotely sensed geodata to inform crossing prioritization, future data acquisition needs and the monitoring of restoration actions. Continue to develop bcfishpass,bcfishobs, fwapg, bcdata and fpr as well as to share open source data analysis and presentation tools that are scaleable and facilitate continual improvement. Tools should continue to be flexible and well documented to allow the future incorporation of alternative fragmentation indicators, habitat gain/value metrics and watershed sensitivity indicators. Continue to collaborate with potential partners to build relationships, explore perspectives and develop “road maps” for aquatic restoration in different situations (MoT roads, rail lines, permit roads of different usages, FSRs, etc.) – documenting the people involved, discussions and processes that are undertaken, funding options, synergies, measures of success, etc. "],["appendix---phase-1-fish-passage-assessment-data-and-photos.html", "Appendix - Phase 1 Fish Passage Assessment Data and Photos", " Appendix - Phase 1 Fish Passage Assessment Data and Photos Location and Stream Data Crossing Characteristics – Date 2021-08-30 Crossing Sub Type Bridge PSCIS ID 197900 Diameter (m) 13.5 External ID 1805532 Length (m) 6 Crew AI Embedded – UTM Zone 9 Depth Embedded (m) – Easting 685314.1 Resemble Channel – Northing 6030317 Backwatered – Stream Crow Creek Percent Backwatered – Road CN Railway Fill Depth (m) – Road Tenure Canadian National Outlet Drop (m) – Channel Width (m) – Outlet Pool Depth (m) – Stream Slope (%) – Inlet Drop – Beaver Activity – Slope (%) – Habitat Value – Valley Fill – Final score 0 Barrier Result Passable Fix type – Fix Span / Diameter – Photos: PSCIS ID 197900.

PSCIS crossing 57944 is located on Highway 16. Crossing 57944 was located 0.2km upstream from the confluence with the Bulkley River. Crossing 57944 is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. Background At crossing 57944, Toboggan Creek is a fifth order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately 119.9km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 2586m to 412m near the crossing (Table 5.1). Upstream of crossing 57944, longnose sucker, cutthroat trout, pink salmon, coho salmon, rainbow trout, steelhead, kokanee, sockeye salmon, chinook salmon, mountain whitefish, dolly varden, sculpin (general), and lamprey (general) have previously been recorded (MoE 2020b; Norris 2020). There is a wealth of information available for Toboggan Creek with numerous references available through the Skeena Salmon Data Centre. fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), footnote_text = &#39;Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above&#39;, scroll = F) Table 5.1: Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing 57944.

The hatchery has been operated by the Toboggan Creek Salmon &amp; Steelhead Enhancement Society since 1985. The hatchery serves to enhance coho and chinook stocks in the watershed as well as help assess coho stock with coded wire tag hatchery releases (Smithers District Chamber of Commerce 2022; Wilson and Rabnett 2007). Office of Wet’suwet’en (2016) report that Toboggan hatchery fish have been used to enhance the Bulkley mainstem, Maxan Creek and Buck Creek with chinook fry and smolt. Office of Wet’suwet’en (2016) note that Wet’suwet’en Knowledge documents Toboggan Lake as a sockey nursery lake. Additionally, as cited in Office of Wet’suwet’en (2016), K. Rabnett, Holland, and Gottesfeld (2017) report a historic fishery at the outlet of Toboggan Lake where an extirpated stock of sockeye stock existed. Toboggan Lake is 25ha in size and modelling indicates an additional 256ha of wetland upstream of the highway. Significantly sized lakes within watersheds can throttle high freshet and storm flows often resulting in increased stability downstream and conditions conducive to egg incubation and juvenile rearing. Works to remediate fish passage issues at PSCIS stream crossing 57944 were conducted in 2015 with backwatering completed through installation of boulders downstream of the crossing (McCarthy and Fernando 2015). Comparison of historic PSCIS photos and data between 2021 and 2012 indicate that the historical recorded outlet drop of 90cm has been reduced to 0cm as a result of the works. Sandra Devcic, DFO Restoration Engineer (pers. comm.) has noted that developing a design to replace the crossing with an open bottom structure presents challenges due to the stream crossing location at the bottom of a hill and on a corner of the highway. In 2021 at the time of the assessment, pink salmon spawners were noted as present at the enumeration fences near the hatchery indicating that the highway structure was passable to these relatively weak swimmers in 2021. PSCIS stream crossing 57944 was ranked as a high priority for follow up by Wilson and Rabnett (2007), Irvine (2018), Irvine (2021) and Mazany-Wright et al. (2021) because of significant amounts of habitat modelled as upstream of the crossing. A summary of habitat modelling outputs is presented in Table 5.2.

The average channel width was 13.9m, the average wetted width was 6.7m and the average gradient was 5.5%. The dominant substrate was cobbles with boulders subdominant. Although rated as an important migration corridor, the habitat was rated as medium value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Stream Characteristics Upstream The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 57944 for 880m (Figures 5.3 - 5.4). Total cover amount was rated as moderate with large woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris and boulders., Total cover amount was rated as moderate with overhanging vegetation dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris and boulders. The average channel width was 8.5m, the average wetted width was 6.7m and the average gradient was 2.1%. The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels subdominant. The first 50 - 100m upstream of crossing channel and banks were noted as armoured with riprap. Abundant gravels suitable for resident and anadromous salmonids were noted throughout. The habitat was rated as high value as an important migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and having moderate rearing potential. The stream was also surveyed at a second location upstream of the hatchery adjacent to the Owen Road bridge for 150m (Figures 5.5 - 5.6). Total cover amount was rated as abundant with deep pools dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation. The average channel width was 12.6m, the average wetted width was 10.5m and the average gradient was 0.5%. The dominant substrate was gravels with fines subdominant. The habitat was rated as high value for salmon rearing and spawning. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS crossing 57944 with a bridge (13.5m span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at $12,150,000 for a cost benefit of 4.3 linear m/$1000 and 36.6 m2/$1000. Conclusion There was 52.4km of habitat modelled upstream of crossing 57944 with areas survyed rated as high value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Crossing 57944 was ranked as a high priority for proceeding to design for replacement. Toboggan Creek represents an extremely important system for the Bulkley River system in terms of fisheries values, it’s function for outreach within the community as well as it’s contribution to stock enhancement and assessment. Development of a plan to replace the crossing with a bridge may be considered as a prudent step to mitigating risks of a blow out of the backwatering works currently in place downstream and a return to conditions similiar to those observed historically when a significant outlet drop was present (Figures 5.7 - 5.8). tab_hab_summary %&gt;% filter(Site == my_site) %&gt;% # select(-Site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), scroll = F) Table 5.4: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 57944.

PSCIS crossing 123544 is located on a private road and 58151 is located on Woodmere Road. Crossing 123544 was located 0.9km upstream from the confluence with the Bulkley River and crossing 58151 was located a further 1773m upstream. Crossing 123544 is located on private land so likely the responsibility of the landowner. Crossing 58151 is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. Background McDowell Creek drains McDowell Lake (35ha), Dorsay Lake (4ha) and one other unnamed lake (9ha) flowing from McDowell Lake in a south then west direction for approximately 9km to the confluence with the Bulkley River adjacent to the Woodmere Nursery. At crossing 123544, McDowell Creek is a third order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately 15.9km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 1038m to 576m near the crossing (Table 5.5). Upstream of crossing 123544, rainbow trout have previously been recorded (MoE 2020b; Norris 2020). An adjacent landowner reports that historic high flow events in the watershed were likely related to beaver dam failures in the upper reaches of the stream network. A habitat confirmation assessment downstream of 123544 PSCIS stream crossing 58159 (Woodmere Nursery private road) was assessed with by Irvine (2021) in 2020 and the reader is directed there for detailed background, habitat assessment and fish sampling information from 2020 surveys. 58151 was ranked as a moderate priority for follow up by Irvine (2018) due to significant quantities of upstream habitat suitable for salmonid rearing.

Total cover amount was rated as abundant with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, boulders, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation. The dominant substrate was gravels with fines sub-dominant. The average channel width was 2.6m, and the average gradient was 2%. Although dry, the channel was well defined with frequent gravels throughout. The undercut banks were deeply cut an riparian vegetation was comprised of thick red-osier dogwood understory and open mature cottonwood forest. Habitat was rated as low value for salmonid rearing and spawning. At the time of the survey, PSCIS culvert 58158 on Highway 16 located approximately had been recently replaced with a baffled structure embedded with a natural cobble and gravel substrates. Although ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage using the provincial metric the crossing is likely not a barrier during most flows for adult anadromous salmon and fluvial salmonids migrating upstream from the Bulkley River. Stream Characteristics Upstream of 123544 and downstream of 58151 The stream was surveyed upstream of crossing 123544 for 25m and downstream from crossing 58151 for 120m (Figures 5.11 - 5.12). The average channel width was 1.7m, and the average gradient was 2%. The dominant substrate was fines with gravels sub-dominant. Total cover amount was rated as abundant with overhanging vegetation dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris and undercut banks. With the exception of the culvert outlet pool, the channel was dry throughout the area surveyed. Riparian vegetation was primarily grass. Habitat value was rated as low as the surveyed area was dry with extensive agricultural development adjacent. Stream Characteristics Upstream of 58151 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 58151 for 70m (Figures 5.13 - 5.14). The average channel width was 1.7m, and the average gradient was 2%. Total cover amount was rated as abundant with overhanging vegetation dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris and undercut banks. The dominant substrate was fines with gravels sub-dominant. Survey notes indicate the well defined channel bed was dry and contained fines and sediment likely from the high amount of development of yards, roads, and agriculture adjacent to the stream. Habitat value was rated as low. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS crossing 123544 with a bridge (10m span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at $300,000 for a cost benefit of 20.2 linear m/$1000 and NA m2/$1000. Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS crossing 58151 with a bridge (3m span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at $400,000 for a cost benefit of 10.8 linear m/$1000 and 18.3 m2/$1000. Relocation of the driveway accessing the private land from the other side of the stream and removal of the crossing could also be considered. Conclusion There was 6.1km of habitat modelled upstream of crossing 58151 with areas surveyed rated as low value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Crossing 123544 was ranked as a low priority for proceeding to design due to low flows and highly impacted habitats upstream. Crossing 58151 was ranked as a low priority for proceeding to design for replacement. In the upper reaches of McDowell Creek, impacts are apparent due to adjacent land use (cattle trampled banks and grazed/removed riparian vegetation). It is recommended that a plan be developed to work with adjacent landowners and tenure holders to exclude cattle from the riparian area, implement stream restoration actions and explore possibilities related to progressive beaver management in the watershed. tab_hab_summary %&gt;% filter(Site == my_site | Site == my_site2) %&gt;% # select(-Site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), scroll = F) Table 5.10: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 123544.

PSCIS crossing 123770 is located on Highway 16. Crossing 123770 was located 0.3km upstream from the confluence with the Bulkley River and is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. Background At crossing 123770, John Brown Creek is a fifth order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately 80.6km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 2050m to 375m near the crossing (Table 5.11). Upstream of crossing 123770, coho salmon, cutthroat trout, rainbow trout, chinook salmon, bull trout, and dolly varden have previously been recorded (MoE 2020b; Norris 2020). A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett (2007) reported that although spawner abundance and location are unknown, chinook have been observed in John Brown Creek at 0.4km. fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), footnote_text = &#39;Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above&#39;, scroll = F) Table 5.11: Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing 123770.

In 1997, the Ministry of Transportation (MoT) worked in partnership with Fisheries and Oceans Canada, the Ministry of Environment, Lands and Parks, Habitat Conservation Trust Fund, and non-governmental organizations (Gitanyow Fisheries Authorities and the Steelhead Society of BC) to identify and resolve fish passage issues at John Brown Creek. A site assessment indicated that the one meter outlet drop and high culvert velocity was blocking the upstream migration of fish. In 2000, MoT designed and implemented baffles to slow velocity and facilitate fish passage through the culvert. In addition, backwatering was done by constructing a tailwater pool and riffle sequence at the outlet. To reduce the height of the culvert from the stream, riprap was placed downstream of the culvert outlet. Post-remediation monitoring was carried out in 2001 during the spring freshet. Competition between the resident bulltrout and Dolly Varden fish species was observed upstream of the culvert (Sweeting n.d.). PSCIS stream crossing 123770 was ranked as a high priority for follow up by Irvine (2018), Irvine (2021) and Mazany-Wright et al. (2021) because of significant amounts of habitat modelled as upstream of the crossing. A summary of habitat modelling outputs is presented in Table 5.12.

Stream Characteristics at Crossing At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing 123770 was non-backwatered and ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011b) (Table 5.13). The crossing consisted on two pipes with baffles installed within the lower elevation pipe. There was a significant outlet drop and the baffled pipe was not embedded for its entire length. Water temperature was 10\\(^\\circ\\)C, pH was 7.2 and conductivity was 94uS/cm. The stream was also assessed at the location of a modelled crossing 1418m upstream from the confluence with the Bulkley River (PSCIS 198043) where a ford was located. fpr::fpr_table_cv_summary_memo() Table 5.13: Summary of fish passage assessment for PSCIS crossing 123770.

Total cover amount was rated as moderate with boulders dominant. Cover was also present as deep pools and overhanging vegetation. The average channel width was 13.6m, the average wetted width was 8.3m and the average gradient was 4.1%. The dominant substrate was large rock/bedrock with cobbles subdominant. Although rated as an important migration corridor, the habitat was rated as medium value for salmonid rearing and spawning with high flows and limited complexity. Several dead pink salmon were noted on the fan at the confluence with the Bulkley River. Stream Characteristics Upstream The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 123770 for 1000m (Figures 5.18 - 5.19). Total cover amount was rated as moderate with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, boulders, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation. The average channel width was 12.2m, the average wetted width was 8.3m and the average gradient was 2.9%. The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels subdominant. The first 50 - 100m upstream of crossing channel and banks were noted as armoured with riprap. Abundant gravels suitable for resident and anadromous salmonids were noted throughout. The habitat was rated as high value as an important migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and having moderate rearing potential. The stream was also surveyed immediately upstream of PSCIS ford 198043 for 350m (Figures 5.20 - 5.21). Total cover amount was rated as moderate with boulders dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris and overhanging vegetation.. The average channel width was 11.2m, the average wetted width was 9.1m and the average gradient was 3%. The dominant substrate was cobbles with boulders subdominant. The habitat was rated as high value for salmon rearing and spawning. Fish Sampling Electrofishing was conducted with results summarised in Tables 5.15 - 5.16 and Figure 5.15. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS crossing 123770 with a bridge (19m span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at $17,100,000 for a cost benefit of 0.7 linear m/$1000 and 8.4 m2/$1000. Conclusion There was 11.7km of habitat modelled upstream of crossing 123770 with areas surveyed rated as high value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Crossing 123770 was ranked as a high priority for proceeding to design for replacement. John Brown Creek is a large system with habitat suitable for numerous species includeing coho, steelhead and chinook salmon. Development of a plan to replace the crossing with a bridge may be considered as a prudent step to eliminating an outlet drop, reducing flow velocities at the highway crossing and mitigating risks of a blow out to the baffle induced partial embedding currently in place in the south pipe of the crossing. tab_hab_summary %&gt;% filter(Site == my_site) %&gt;% # select(-Site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), scroll = F) Table 5.14: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 123770.

Station Creek is also known locally as Mission Creek. PSCIS crossing 124420 is located on Highway 16. Crossing 124420 was located 1.8km upstream from the confluence with the Bulkley River. Crossing 124420 is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. Background At crossing 124420, Station Creek is a fourth order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately 28.6km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 2171m to 211m near the crossing (Table 5.17). Upstream of crossing 124420, cutthroat trout, pink salmon, coho salmon, rainbow trout, bull trout, and dolly varden have previously been recorded (MoE 2020b; Norris 2020). Wilson and Rabnett (2007) report that the crossing structure located on Highway 16 and Station Creek has been the subject of numerous assessments and designs with respect to the rehabilitation of fish passage, and they rated this crossing as the highest priority for rehabilitation in the Bulkley River watershed. Gitxsan Watershed Authority reports that Xsan Xsagiibil was a fishing site located at the mouth of Station Creek (Xsi Gwin Sagiiblax) (Wilson and Rabnett 2007). Identified as a high priority for additional assessments by K. Rabnett and Williams (2004), SKR Consultants Ltd. (2006) conducted a detailed inspection, offered rehabilitation design options and identified the natural limits of potential fish distribution to support rehabilitation efforts. At the time of reporting, a design for remediation utilizing a retrofit of the existing structure to backwater the pipe was being drafted (Sean Wong, Environmental Programs Manager - Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure pers. comm.). A trap and truck operation led by the Chicago Creek Community Environmental Enhancement Society moves coho from a fence set up near the confluence with the Bulkley River to upstream of Highway 16 on Waterfall Creek annually. Houlden, Houlden, and Donas (2001) report that the coho stocks in the system were wiped out in the late 1970s by the improper installation of PSCIS crossing 124420. The Waterfall Creek Stream Rehabilitation Project began in 1990 to reintroduce coho to the stream with surplus stocks transplanted from Toboggan Creek near Smithers. In 1993 the Hazelton Elementary Streamkeepers program was developed to assist with the project and in 1995 the Chicago Creek Community Environmental Enhancement Society was incorporated to develop a hatchery nearby. The hatchery no longer operates but operations were considered successful with coho runs between 65 - 297 fish documented between 1998 - 2001 Watershed restoration and enhancement efforts were coordinated with other groups working in the system (Houlden, Houlden, and Donas 2001; Houlden and Donas 2002). Following stream morphology changes which occurred during a fall 2017 flood event causing the release and distribution of sediment loads, Newman and England (2018) conducted a fish habitat assessment from the confluence of Station Creek with the Bulkley River upstream to the Mile 48 Canadian National railway crossing to determine stream diversity, spawning gravel catchment areas, beaver dam activity and negative impacts present in or along the stream. Beaver control activities on Station and Waterfall Creeks by CN Rail upstream of crossing 124420 may have been the cause of the 2017 flood event (pers comm.

Stream Characteristics at Crossings At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing 124420 was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011b) (Table 5.19). Water temperature was 8\\(^\\circ\\)C, pH was 7.9 and conductivity was 89uS/cm. PSCIS crossing 124421 on Waterfall Creek was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011b) (Table 5.20). PSCIS crossing 124422 on Waterfall Creek was un-embedded, 100% backwatered and ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011b) (Table 5.21). Surveys were conducted with a remotely piloted aircraft upstream of the crossing with resulting images stitched into an orthomosaic and 3-dimensional model presented in Figures 5.22 - 5.23. fpr::fpr_table_cv_summary_memo() Table 5.19: Summary of fish passage assessment for PSCIS crossing 124420.

Total cover amount was rated as with large woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, boulders, and overhanging vegetation (Table 5.22). The average channel width was 6.1m, the average wetted width was 4.6m and the average gradient was 2.1%. The dominant substrate was gravels with cobbles subdominant. Survey notes indicate a complex system with deeply undercut banks with steep sections and confined areas. Segments of stream showed signs of erosion and deposition of fine sediments. Multiple areas with braided channels around woody debris and evidence of large fluctuations in flow were noted. The habitat was rated as high value for salmonid rearing and spawning. The reader is referred to Newman and England (2018) for addition information on habitat containing more detail. Stream Characteristics Upstream of 124420 and downstream of 124421 The stream was surveyed immediately upstream from 124420 for approximately 370m (Figures 5.26 - 5.27). Within the area surveyed, total cover amount was rated as with large woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, undercut banks, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation (Table 5.22). The average channel width was 5.7m, the average wetted width was 4.7m and the average gradient was 2%. The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels subdominant. There were frequent pockets of gravels suitable for spawning throughout with high value spawning habitat in upper end of the survey area. Habitat value was rated as high value for resident salmonid rearing and spawning. The reader is referred to Newman and England (2018) for addition information on habitat in this area. A small bridge (modelled crossing 24704553 - a.k.a Mile 48) is located under the CN Railway approximately 875m upstream of the highway. At approximately 1200m upstream of Highway 16, Waterfall Creek enters into station Creek. In addition to the survey via drone, Waterfall Creek was assessed immediately upstream of the confluence with Station Creek for 430m (Figures 5.28 - 5.29) Total cover amount was rated as abundant with instream vegetation dominant. Cover was also present as undercut banks, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation.The average channel width was 6.2m, the average wetted width was 5.5m, and the average gradient was 0.5%.The dominant substrate was fines with gravels sub-dominant. The area assessed included slow flowing wetland type habitat with generally shallow glide type habitat and significant quantities of instream vascular vegetation. Habitat value for areas surveyed was rated as high value as the area could provide significant amounts of rearing habitat for juvenile rainbow and coho. Crossing 1803294 is modeled on Waterfall Creek at a location approximately 2.6km upstream of Highway 16 crossing 124420 and approximately 965m downstream of PSCIS crossing 124421. This site was not assessed in the field and data regarding this crossing has not previously been loaded to PSCIS. Access to this location should by possible by wading across Waterfall Creek from access on the railway line. At the time of assessment, the road leading to the crossing from the north was behind a gated area on private land. PSCIS crossing 124424 is located under the railway line approximately 55m downstream of 11th avenue where PSCIS crossing 124421 is located. PSCIS records indicate this crossing was non-embedded and 100% backwatered. Although ranking as a barrier according to the provincial protocol, 100% backwatered crossings are seldom an issue for fish passage for any lifestage or species. Upstream of 124424 the stream was assessed to PSCIS crossing 124421.The average channel width was 6.7m, the average wetted width was 11.9m, and the average gradient was 0.6%.The dominant substrate was fines with gravels sub-dominant.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with instream vegetation dominant. Cover was also present as deep pools and overhanging vegetation. Survey notes indicate that below the crossing the water enters a wetland type complex dense in grasses and shrubs. Deep water and dense instream vegetation were present with the wetland/stream running relatively straight and parallel to the railway. Water depth was estimated at ~1.5m near the stream edge. Habitat value was rated as moderate with surveyor notes indicating a defined channel that widens into a small wetland complex dominated by tall grasses and significant instream vegetation. ##this is useful to get some comments for the report hab_site %&gt;% filter(site == my_site4 &amp; location == &#39;ds&#39;) %&gt;% pull(comments) my_priority &lt;- my_priority_info() Stream Characteristics Upstream of 124421 and downstream of 124422 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 124421 for 120m to 124422 (Figures 5.30 - 5.31). Total cover amount was rated as abundant with instream vegetation dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation.The dominant substrate was fines with gravels sub-dominant.The average channel width was 2.6m, the average wetted width was 2.5m, and the average gradient was 1%. Survey notes indicate a slow moving wetland like stream with deep glides throughout. Instream vegetation was abundant with somewhat stagnant water often smelling of sulfur. Near top of the survey, the gradient increased slightly and the substrate transitioned from primarily fines to small gravel. Within the riparian area shrubs and sedges were thick and vigorous. Habitat value was rated as moderate as the this section of stream was considered an important migration corridor. Stream Characteristics Upstream of 124422 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 124422 for 350m (Figures 5.32 - 5.33). Total cover amount was rated as abundant with instream vegetation dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation.The average channel width was 6.7m, the average wetted width was 6.6m, and the average gradient was 1%.The dominant substrate was fines with gravels sub-dominant. Within this section of stream there appears to have been restorative efforts involving the placement of logs to provide riffle pool breaks and retain gravel suitable for coho spawning. Gravels were abundant in this area and it’s location within a residential area of New Hazelton provides an important connection between the stream and the surrounding community. Habitat value was rated as moderate as the this section of stream was considered critical for coho spawning. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS crossing 124420 with a bridge (30m span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at $27,000,000 for a cost benefit of 0.3 linear m/$1000 and 2 m2/$1000. These cost benefit estimates assume that adult coho spawner passage through 124420 will result in passage through upstream crossings which rank as barriers according to the provincial metric but are likely to be passable to adult coho. # The cost of the work is estimated at \\$`r format(my_cost_estimate() %&gt;% pull(cost_est_1000s) * 1000, big.mark = &#39;,&#39;)` for a cost benefit of `r as.character(my_cost_estimate() %&gt;% pull(cost_net))` linear m/\\$1000 and `r as.character(my_cost_estimate() %&gt;% pull(cost_area_net))`m^2^/\\$1000. Conclusion There was 9.3km of habitat modelled upstream of crossing 124420 with areas surveyed rated as high value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Crossing 124420 was ranked as a high priority for proceeding to design for replacement. At the time of reporting, the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure was in the process of developing a design to retrofit the existing structure at 124420 with some sort of backwatering mechanism so that it could pass adult coho spawners. Although, backwatering can be considered an interim solution, replacement of this crossing with an open bottom structure is recommended in the long term. Station and Waterfall Creeks are located directly within the community of New Hazelton and there is a rich history of community efforts to help restore coho stocks and enhance the habitat in the system. This location and history provide importing context for the connection between the community, the Gitsxan, the salmon and the watershed. Station Creek is a unique opportunity for CP Rail, the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, DFO, the Chicago Creek Community Environmental Enhancement Society, the community of New Hazelton, the Gitsxan and other to work together for meaningful restorative actions. tab_hab_summary %&gt;% filter(Site == my_site | Site == my_site2 | Site == my_site3 ) %&gt;% # select(-Site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;, &#39;, my_site2, &#39; and &#39;, my_site3, &#39;.&#39;), scroll = F) Table 5.22: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 124420, 124421 and 124422.

Information sourced from the provincial Forest Tenure Road Section Lines spatial layer indicates YLP Woodlands GP Ltd. is a road tenure holder at the crossing location (MoE 2024). YLP Woodlands GP Ltd. is part of the Yinka Dene Economic Development Limited Partnership (YLP) which is the corporate business arm of the Wet’suwet’en First Nation. Background PSCIS crossing 197378 on Klate Lake road is located in the Bi Wini house territory, in the house of Keexwinits (House in the Middle of Many) that belongs to the Gitdumden (Bear/Wolf) clan within Wet’suwet’en territory (BC Parks 2010). Felix George 7 First Nation Reserve lands are located on the east side of Owen Lake near the site. A provincial recreation site is also located near the site on the northern tip of Owen Lake This memo has been updated to reflect ongoing activities related to the restoration of fish passage at the site. The culvert on Klate Lake Road has been earmarked for replacement through the Bii Wenii Kwa Restoration/Recovery Plan which is a collaboration between the Wet’suwet’en Treaty Society, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, BC Ministry of Forests, and Water, Land and Resource Stewardship, Morice Water Monitoring Trust, and Northwest Research and Monitoring. The plan aims to improve watershed health and support both resident and anadromous fish while helping the Wet’suwet’en, and Federal and Provincial governments address habitat risks by enhancing and restoring fish habitat, consolidating existing data, prioritizing restoration work, and providing monitoring recommendations (Morgan and Reese-Hansen 2024). Klate Lake Road provides access to Nadina Mountain Park. The park was established through a partnership between BC Parks and the Office of the Wet’suwet’en as part of the Morice Land and Resource Management Plan. It is one of seven protected areas resulting from government-to-government agreements. The park protects important cultural, spiritual, and ecological values, including habitat for mountain goats and rare plant communities. Recreational use is non-motorized and includes hiking, hunting, and wildlife viewing. Management priorities focus on conserving ecological integrity and Wet’suwet’en heritage while allowing low-impact education and recreation. Nadina means “standing up alone” in the Wet’suwet’en language (BC Parks 2010, 2025; ILMB 2007). Klate Lake Road accesses a challenging trail that climbs the northeast slope of Nadina Mountain into the provincial park. The trail begins at an elevation of 867m and reaches alpine at 1686m, where the route becomes unmarked. From there, hikers choose their own path to the 2125m summit. A second, longer route to the alpine begins at Nadina Mountain Lodge on Owen Lake, passing Klate and Base Lakes, but this route is documented as overgrown and difficult due to lack of recent maintenance. The Berkey-Howe Union Spire is a free-standing granite pillar located at the head of the large cirque on the north-east exposure of the peak (BC Parks 2025). Following the recommendations from the 2022 survey (provided in an initial release of this report), crossing 197378 was revisited September 13, 2023 with electrofishing conducted above and below the crossing to gather baseline fisheries data. Results from the sampling have been incorporated into updated versions of this report. In 2024, an engineering design was commissioned by SERNbc to replace the culvert with a bridge. The design was completed in 2025 by Pacific North Coast Consulting Services. Proposed works include the replacement of the existing 1.0m wide round culvert with a 12m free span bridge. The engineering design and associated background information is included as an attachment to this report and linked here. At crossing 197378, Tributary to Owen Creek is a third order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately 7.9km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 2073m to 758m at the crossing (Table 5.23). A total of 3ha of lake and 48ha of wetland is modelled upstream. Upstream of crossing 197378, longnose dace, rainbow trout, mountain whitefish, and dolly varden have previously been recorded (MoE 2020b; Norris 2020). The nearby Owen Lake is approximately 300ha in size. Historical records of fish in this lake include rainbow trout, burbot, coho, sucker, dolly varden, lake trout, and whitefish. my_caption &lt;- &quot;Map showing PSCIS crossing 197378 on Klate Lake / Nadina Mountain Road.&quot; knitr::include_graphics(&quot;data/inputs_raw/klate_lake_road_trib_to_owen_197378.jpeg&quot;) Figure 5.36: Map showing PSCIS crossing 197378 on Klate Lake / Nadina Mountain Road. fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), footnote_text = &#39;Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above&#39;, scroll = F) Table 5.23: Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing 197378.

Stream Characteristics at Crossing At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing 197378 was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011b) (Table 5.25). The pipe was in very rough condition and had collapsed and separated in half which effected water flow into the barrel. The water temperature was 11\\(^\\circ\\)C, pH was 7.6 and conductivity was 84uS/cm. fpr::fpr_table_cv_summary_memo() Table 5.25: Summary of fish passage assessment for PSCIS crossing 197378.

The dominant substrate was gravels with fines sub-dominant.Total cover amount was rated as abundant with overhanging vegetation dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris and undercut banks.The average channel width was 2.4m, the average wetted width was 1.9m, and the average gradient was 2.5%. There was a high percentage of crown closure, with riparian shrubs but a thin, coniferous forest further upland. There was an numerous pockets of gravels suitable for rainbow and dolly varden spawning. The stream appeared to have stable flows with no notable erosion. Overall, the habitat was rated as medium value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Stream Characteristics Upstream The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 197378 for 665m (Figure 5.39). The average channel width was 1.8m, the average wetted width was 1.5m, and the average gradient was 3%.The dominant substrate was gravels with fines sub-dominant.Total cover amount was rated as abundant with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, overhanging vegetation, and instream vegetation. This was a small stream containing multiple beaver influenced wetland areas with dams. The stream was comprised of two seperate channels mapped as converging approximatley 100m upstream of the crossing. The dominant channel was the stream mapped as furthest north in the freshwater atlas. It was surveyed in an upstream direction to the location of a beaver influenced wetland. Several pockets of gravel suitable for resident rainbow and dolly varden spawning were present. Surveyors noted “nice runs” and good flow volume. The habitat was rated as medium value with moderate rearing potential. Surveyors visited the southern channel at a point approximately 350m upstream of the FSR but the stream channel at this location was very small with fine sediment substrate. Fish Sampling As noted above - following recommendations from the 2022 survey, crossing 197378 was revisited on September 13, 2023 and electrofishing was conducted upstream and downstream of Klate Lake. Results are summarised in Tables 5.27 - 5.28 and Figure 5.37. A total of 7 rainbow trout were captured upstream, and 11 rainbow trout were captured downstream (Figures 5.40 - 5.41). All fish captured with a fork length greater than 60mm were tagged with Passive Integrated Transponders (PIT tags) with data stored here. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS crossing 197378 with a bridge (10m span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at $300,000 for a cost benefit of 1.9 linear m/$1000 and 3.4 m2/$1000. Conclusion There was 0.6km of habitat modelled upstream of crossing 197378 modelled as highing high intrinsic value for steelhead based on gradient and width. Areas surveyed were rated as medium value for salmonid rearing with large areas of wetland present. The culvert pipe was noted as in very poor condition with the structure near complete collapse. Although fish sampling within small areas upstream and downstream of the crossing in 2023 resulted in the capture of rainbow trout only, other species such as coho utilizing the mainstem of Owen Creek may have accessed this area historically. The Office of Wet’suwet’en has initiated watershed level Nation led recovery/restoration planning for the greater Bii Wenii Kwa (Owen Creek) watershed which includes restoration of this site as a project priority consideration. As the Yinka Dene Economic Development Limited Partnership is noted as a road tenure holder at the location of the site, there could be opportunities for collaboration between the two groups related to restoration or removal of the crossing. Crossing 197378 was ranked as a moderate priority for proceeding to design for replacement. In 2024, an engineering design was commissioned by SERNbc to replace the culvert with a bridge. The design was completed in 2025 by Pacific North Coast Consulting Services. Proposed works include the replacement of the existing 1.0m wide round culvert with a 12m free span bridge. tab_hab_summary %&gt;% filter(Site == my_site) %&gt;% # select(-Site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), scroll = F) Table 5.26: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 197378.

Highway 16 is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. Background At crossing 197662, Richfield Creek is a fifth order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately 161.3km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 1753m to 650m near the crossing (Table 5.29). Upstream of crossing 197662, longnose sucker, lake chub, longnose dace, coho salmon, rainbow trout, steelhead, and chinook salmon have previously been recorded upstream (MoE 2020b; Norris 2020).

Fencing of the area complemented significant restoration work completed in by the Morice Watershed Monitoring Trust project which included bank stabilization, installation of vertical posts for bank stability, live stakeing of willow/cottonwood and planting of rooted willow plugs. Details of the work conducted is documented in Wrench (2022) and included as Attachment 4. Conclusion There was 197662 is 32.8km of habitat modelled upstream of the crossing with areas surveyed in 2020 rated as high value for salmonid rearing and spawning (Irvine 2021). There is extensive background information on this system summarized in Irvine (2021) and in development at the time of reporting. Crossing 197662 was ranked as a high priority for proceeding to design for replacement. As Richfield Creek is a high value fish stream with cold water inputs and significant historic and ongoing impacts due to adjacent land use (linear development, residential development, cattle trampled banks and grazed/removed riparian vegetation) it is recommended that individuals, organizations and regulators continue to work with adjacent landowners and tenure holders to implement stream restoration actions, exclude cattle from the riparian area, and explore possibilities related to progressive beaver management in the watershed. knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE) source(&#39;scripts/packages.R&#39;) source(&#39;scripts/tables.R&#39;) my_site &lt;- 197909 # my_site2 &lt;- 123377 "],["tributary-to-maxan-creek---197909---appendix.html", "Tributary to Maxan Creek - 197909 - Appendix Site Location Background Stream Characteristics at Crossing Stream Characteristics Downstream Stream Characteristics Upstream Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Conclusion", " Tributary to Maxan Creek - 197909 - Appendix Site Location PSCIS crossing 197909 is located on Tributary to Maxan Creek adjacent to the west side of Maxan Lake located south of Topley, BC. PSCIS crossing 197909 is located on Maxan Creek FSR. Crossing 197909 was located 1.8km upstream from the confluence with Maxan Lake. Crossing 198043 is the responsibility of the Ministry of Forests. Background At crossing 197909, Tributary to Maxan Creek is a first order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately 2.1km2.

Although information regarding sampling effort is not present, site card notes indicate the site was classified as S6 (non-fish bearing) due to a lack of significant fish habitat. PSCIS stream crossing 198043 was ranked as a moderate priority for follow up during field assessments because of the presence of modelled habitat upstream and relatively good flows in t he stream when compared to the rest of the culverted streams surveyed in the greater Maxan Creek watershed (Table 5.35.

Total cover amount was rated as moderate with overhanging vegetation dominant. Cover was also present as undercut banks. The average channel width was 1.3m, the average wetted width was 1.3m, and the average gradient was 3.2%. Substrate was composed of fines. At approximately 300m downstream of the culvert the stream became wider with glide habitat to ~50cm in depth resulting from sediments deposited by a failure on the steep north canyon wall. Habitat was rated as low value for salmonid rearing and spawning due to the small size of the stream, low flows and fine substrate. Stream Characteristics Upstream The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 197909 for 100m to the location of a series of large beaver dams (Figures 5.51 - 5.52). Substrate was composed of fines. Cover was present as overhanging vegetation and as deep pool due to beaver influenced water impoundment. Habitat value was rated as moderate value as the area could provide significant amounts of rearing habitat for rainbow and coho if access from downstream was possible. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed at the site, replacement of PSCIS crossing 197909 with a clear span bridge is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at $100,000 for a cost benefit of 2.2 linear m/$1000 and 2.9 m2/$1000. Conclusion Although past assessment work in the watershed indicates stream is likely non-fish bearing (MoE 2020e), there was 0.2km of habitat and 27.7ha of wetland type habitat modelled upstream of crossing 197909 with areas surveyed rated as moderate value for rainbow trout and coho rearing. Crossing 197909 was ranked as a low priority for proceeding to design for removal however this ranking could be revisited in the future should fish presence or potential for fish presence be confirmed through subsequent survey activities. tab_hab_summary %&gt;% filter(Site == my_site) %&gt;% # select(-Site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), scroll = F) Table 5.37: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 197909.

Stream Characteristics at Crossing At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing 197912 was comprised of a collapsing bridge (Table 5.40). The structure may have been presenting an impediment to upstream fish passage for adult fish and the bridge debris in the channel was resulting in erosion of the banks adjacent to the historic structure. Water temperature was 12\\(^\\circ\\)C, pH was 8 and conductivity was 283uS/cm. Surveys were conducted with a remotely piloted aircraft immediately upstream and downstream of the crossing with resulting images stitched into an orthomosaic and 3-dimensional model presented in Figures 5.53 - 5.54. fpr::fpr_table_cv_summary_memo() Table 5.40: Summary of fish passage assessment for PSCIS crossing 197912.

The average channel width was 4.7m, the average wetted width was 3.2m and the average gradient was 1.2%. The dominant substrate was gravels with fines subdominant. The habitat was rated as medium value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Stream Characteristics Upstream of 197912 The stream was surveyed immediately upstream from 197912 for approximately 340m to the location of a large beaver dam (Figures 5.59 - 5.60). Within the area surveyed, total cover amount was rated as with deep pools dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, undercut banks, overhanging vegetation, and instream vegetation (Table 5.41). The average channel width was 4.3m, the average wetted width was 2.5m and the average gradient was 1.5%. The dominant substrate was gravels with fines subdominant. Habitat value was rated as high value for resident salmonid rearing and spawning. Fish Sampling Electrofishing was conducted downstream of the collapsed bridge with results summarised in Tables 5.42 - 5.43 and Figure 5.56. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed at the site, removal of PSCIS crossing 197912 is recommended. In addition to removal of the collapsed bridge, resloping of banks and the installation of live cuttings/pegboarding is recommended in three areas downstream where cattle trampling is resulting in significant erosion. A map of the erosion areas and associated prescriptions for rehabilitation of the downstream corners is provided as Figure 5.55. The cost of the work is estimated at $30,000 for a cost benefit of 924 linear m/$1000 and 3973.2 m2/$1000. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/robert_hatch_plan_20211023_k_.JPG&quot;) Figure 5.55: Restoration plan for Robert Hatch Creek including removal of collapsed bridge, resloping of banks and the installation of live cuttings/pegboarding Conclusion There was 197912 is 27.7km of habitat modelled upstream of crossing with areas surveyed rated as high value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Crossing 197912 was ranked as a moderate priority for proceeding to design for removal. As Robert Hatch Creek appears to be a high value fish stream with significant impacts due to adjacent land use (cattle trampled banks and grazed/removed riparian vegetation), it is recommended that a plan be developed to work with adjacent landowners and tenure holders to exclude cattle from the riparian area, implement stream restoration actions and explore possibilities related to progressive beaver management in the watershed. tab_hab_summary %&gt;% filter(Site == my_site) %&gt;% # select(-Site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), scroll = F) Table 5.41: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 197912.

PSCIS crossing 197960 is located on CN Railway. Crossing 197960 was located 2.7km upstream from the confluence with the Bulkley River. Crossing 197960 is the responsibility of the Canadian National Railway. Background At crossing 197960, Corya Creek is a fourth order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately 65.7km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 2502m to 410m near the crossing (Table 5.44). Upstream of crossing 197960, rainbow trout and dolly varden have previously been recorded (MoE 2020b; Norris 2020). PSCIS crossing 124612 is a bridge located 800m upstream at the powerline crossing and PSCIS crossing 123776 is a newly installed bridge downstream on Highway 16. Witset Creek drains Witset Lake and is a tributary to Corya Creek that flows in immediately downstream of the Highway 16 bridge. Witset Lake is 41ha in size with an associated 12ha of wetland. The upper Corya Creek watershed is glaciated and may provide habitat conditions most suitable for bull trout and cutthroat due to cold water and turbid conditions due to glacial flour. Although only rainbow trout and dolly varden have previously been recorded upstream of the railway, the historic culvert under Highway 16 and the current culvert under the railway may have hindered passage by other species including anadromous salmon. In spring of 2017 a flood event caused by beaver dam failure forced the evacuation of homes in the Two Mile subdivision of Moricetown (Smithers Interior News 2017). Since this time beaver control activities have taken place in both the Corya and Witset watersheds to reduce the risk of flooding (pers comm.

Total cover amount was rated as moderate with overhanging vegetation dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, undercut banks, and deep pools. The average channel width was 25.4m, the average wetted width was 8.9m and the average gradient was 1.7%. The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels subdominant. The stream was moderately turbid due to glacial flour with abundant quantities of gravels suitably sized for trout and salmon species present. The stream channel was noted as riffle dominated with a lack of complexity due to adjacent riparian clearing and dyke installation. The habitat was rated as medium value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Stream Characteristics Upstream of 197960 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 197960 for 1000m (Figures 5.64 - 5.65). Total cover amount was rated as moderate with overhanging vegetation dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, boulders, and undercut banks. The average channel width was 18m, the average wetted width was 8.9m and the average gradient was 2.8%. The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels subdominant. The first 50 - 100m upstream of crossing channel and banks were noted as armoured with riprap. Abundant gravels suitable for resident and anadromous salmonids were noted throughout. The habitat was rated as medium value as an important migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and having moderate rearing potential. Stream Characteristics Downstream of 123775 The stream was surveyed downstream from crossing 123775 for 100m . The average channel width was 0.5m and the average gradient was 1%. The channel was poorly defined, indicating flows were intermittently only. The habitat was rated as low value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Stream Characteristics Upstream of 123775 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 123775 for 200m . Total cover amount was rated as moderate with overhanging vegetation dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, and instream vegetation. The average channel width was 2.4m, the average wetted width was 0.9m and the average gradient was 1.2%. The dominant substrate was gravels with fines subdominant. Water in channel was most likely from the previous rainfall. Beaver activity was present, the water level was extremely low and there was no flow. Witset maintenance actively traps beavers to prevent flood events as of 2017. The habitat was rated as low value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Fish Sampling To assess potential impacts of the culvert on fisheries values in the stream, electrofishing was conducted with results summarised in Tables 5.49 - 5.50 and Figure 5.61. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS crossing 197960 with a bridge (23m span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at $20,700,000 for a cost benefit of 0.5 linear m/$1000 and 8.7 m2/$1000. Conclusion There was 10km of habitat upstream of crossing 197960 rated as medium value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Crossing 197960 was ranked as a high priority for proceeding to design for replacement. The stream is a cold water glaciated system and may currently provide habitat conditions most suitable for dolly varden and cutthrout trout. Crossing 197960 was ranked as a low priority for remediation at the time of reporting due to low habitat value within the channel connecting Witset Lake to Corya Creek, upstream and downstream of crossing 123775. Beaver control activities within the watershed to reduce the risk of flooding in the Moricetown likely impacts flow patterns (shorter freshet and flashier flows following precipitation) and the subsequent habitat quality in Witset Creek. A watershed level plan to hold more water on the landscape upstream of the highway and increase the capacity of PSCIS crossing 197960 to pass higher flow events could be considered in the long term to increase the overall health of the watershed and improve the potential for connectivity between Corya Creek and Witset Lake. tab_hab_summary %&gt;% filter(Site == my_site | Site == my_site2) %&gt;% # select(-Site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39; and &#39;, my_site2, &#39;.&#39;), scroll = F) Table 5.48: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 197960 and 123775.

Crossing 197962 was located on Morice FSR approximately 1.2km upstream from the confluence with the Morice River. Crossing 197962 is the responsibility of the Ministry of Forests. Background At crossing 197962, Peacock Creek is a fourth order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately 36.3km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 1822m to 654m near the crossing (Table 5.51). Upstream of crossing 197962, no fish species have previously been recorded within provincial databases (MoE 2020b; Norris 2020). McCarthy and Fernando (2015) and Smith (2018) reported that a large concrete weir and spillway that were built in the 1990s were not functioning correctly and that the crossing was a high priority fish barrier. Gaboury and Smith (2016) conducted a site survey in 2015 and produced design options to remediate passage. There were no records of crossing 197962 within PSCIS before the 2021 assessment data was loaded in.

Conclusion Access was restored to an estimated 4.8km of habitat modelled upstream of crossing 197962 due to the replacement of the culvert with a clear span bridge. Although numerous dolly varden and several rainbow trout were captured upstream, coho salmon were captured downstream only before the site restoration indicating that 197962 was a complete barrier to upstream fish passage. The completion of three multi-pass closed electrofishing sites both upstream and downstream of the crossing can provide baseline data for future effectiveness monitoring at the site to track changes in fish population structure resulting from the works. tab_hab_summary %&gt;% filter(Site == my_site) %&gt;% # select(-Site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), scroll = F) Table 5.54: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 197962.

PSCIS crossing 197967 is located on Highway 16, approximately 2.5km upstream from Bulkley Lake. Although Taman Creek flows into this stream approximately 750m upstream of the highway, the stream at the highway is commonly referred to as Taman Creek including on highway signage. The culvert is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. Background At crossing 197967, the Upper Bulkey River is a fifth order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately 93.8km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 1373m to 375m near the crossing (Table 5.57). Upstream of crossing 197967, longnose sucker, largescale sucker, lake chub, brassy minnow, northern pikeminnow, longnose dace, redside shiner, and rainbow trout have previously been recorded (MoE 2020b; Norris 2020). fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), footnote_text = &#39;Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above&#39;, scroll = F) Table 5.57: Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing 197967.

They also report excellent and good rearing potential in upper reaches of the stream located from 5.1km to 7.8km upstream of the confluence. McCarthy and Fernando (2015) report that the culvert has received past efforts to facilitate backwatering including rock lines to establish backwater pools downstream of the culvert. They also report that the works were not functioning correctly. Smith (2018) visited the site in 2017, subjectively rated the crossing as a potential barrier and ranked the crossing as a low priority for follow up. Irvine (2021) noted that a design was being drafted for the Highway 16 crossing by Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure in 2021. PSCIS stream crossing 197967 was ranked as a high priority for follow up by Mazany-Wright et al. (2021) because of significant amounts of habitat modelled as upstream of the crossing and because gathering of habitat confirmation information was considered as potentially beneficial for informing prioritization of the site should remediation plans stall. A total of 172ha of lake and 695ha of wetland is modelled upstream and a summary of habitat modelling outputs is presented in Table 5.58.

Stream Characteristics at Crossing At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing 197967 was non-backwatered and ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011b) (Table 5.59). Water temperature was 12\\(^\\circ\\)C, pH was 7.2 and conductivity was 359uS/cm. A beaver dam was noted just upstream of the culvert inlet (~1.5m high). fpr::fpr_table_cv_summary_memo() Table 5.59: Summary of fish passage assessment for PSCIS crossing 197967.

The dominant substrate was cobbles with fines sub-dominant.Total cover amount was rated as trace with overhanging vegetation dominant. Cover was also present as deep pools and instream vegetation.The average channel width was 5.7m, the average wetted width was 3.1m, and the average gradient was 2.5%. The site was noted as having significant amounts of thick red colored algae for the majority of survey. Flow was very low with uncommon pools. Fence material was noted in or across channel in two locations and and riparian vegetation had been removed where an agricultural field and fence line were close. Although considered an important migration corridor, the habitat was rated as medium value for salmonid rearing and spawning due to limited complexity resulting from adjacent agricultural activities. PSCIS crossing 197964 is located on the CN Railway approximately 1.7km downstream of the highway. Although the crossing was assessed as a potential barrier according to the provincial protocol it was 100% backwatered at the time of the assessment and appeared passable to all species and life stages at the time of assessment (Table 5.60). fpr::fpr_table_cv_summary_memo(dat = pscis_phase1, site = 1805529, site_photo_id = 1805529, col_filter = my_crossing_reference) Table 5.60: Summary of fish passage assessment for PSCIS crossing 1805529.

Total cover amount was rated as moderate with deep pools dominant. Cover was also present as large woody debris and overhanging vegetation.The average channel width was 5.3m, the average wetted width was 2.3m, and the average gradient was 1.7%.The dominant substrate was gravels with cobbles sub-dominant. The first ~250m of channel upstream of the highway were noted as beaver influenced wetland with extensive dry sections at the time of the survey. Frequent pockets of gravels and small cobbles suitable for rainbow trout and coho salmon spawning were noted throughout the area surveyed. A canyon section of stream was located upstream of the crossing approximately 300m contained deep bedrock pools with small fish present and no large woody debris. One deep pool upstream of the canyon section contained likely 2-3 year old juveniles (coloring indicated rainbow trout, unverified). The habitat was rated as medium value as an important migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and having moderate rearing potential. Taman Creek was surveyed for 400m above where it joins the Bulkley River mainstem upstream of PSCIS crossing 197967 (Figures 5.77 - 5.78). The dominant substrate was gravels with cobbles sub-dominant.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with deep pools dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation.The average channel width was 3.8m, the average wetted width was 2.2m, and the average gradient was 1.5%. The water in Taman Creek during the survey was noted as turbid with numerous samlonid fry present at the downstream end of the site. Algae was abundant throughout the system and eroding banks were common. Abundant gravels suitable for resident rainbow trout and coho salmon spawning were present and habitat was rated as medium value for salmon rearing and spawning. The upper Bulkley River was surveyed at numerous crossings upstream of the highway with bridges noted at PSCIS crossings 197968, 197969, 197973 and 197971. Survey crews were not able to access crossing 1802047 from Highway 16 due to a gate and private land postings. This crossing is located between Broman Lake and Old Woman Lake with public access potentially possible by ATV from the powerline to the north. Modelled crossing 1802663 is located on the mainstem of Taman Creek 1.8km upstream of the confluence with the upper Bulkley River. Although this site was not assessed it was considered likely to be a ford due to its location on the powerline. Numerous other unassessed crossings are modelled as located upstream within the system on Taman Creek as well as the upper Bulkley River and their tributaries. As the effort required to assess all these crossings was likely significant with the majority of higher value gains most likely present in the lower reaches, field time was allocated elsewhere in the greater Bulkley River watershed. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS crossing 197967 with a bridge (31m span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at $27,900,000 for a cost benefit of 1.9 linear m/$1000 and 9.9 m2/$1000. Conclusion There was 51.9km of habitat modelled upstream of crossing 197967 rated as medium value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Crossing 197967 was ranked as a moderate priority for proceeding to design for replacement. At the time of reporting, the Ministry of transportation and Infrastructure were in the process of planning for crossing replacement. Of note, due to budgetary constraints, survey plans for the site call for horizontal drilling of a closed bottom structure under the highway with costs likley lower than those estimated for replacement with a clear span bridge. Should structure replacement proceed follow up monitoring is recomended to assess passability and utilization of the crossing by downstream fish populations including coho who have been recorded in the upper Bulkley River within 100m downstream of crossing 197967. tab_hab_summary %&gt;% filter(Site == my_site) %&gt;% # select(-Site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), scroll = F) Table 5.61: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 197967.

PSCIS crossing 197976 is located on Highway 16 and 197975 is located on a private driveway. Crossing 197976 was located 4.2km upstream from the confluence with the Bulkley River and crossing 197975 was located 393m upstream fo Highway 16. Crossing 197976 is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure and crossing 197976 is the responsibility of the private land owner. Background At crossing 197976, Ailport Creek is a fifth order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately 66.9km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 1445m to 375m near the crossing (Table 5.62). Upstream of crossing 197976, cutthroat trout, coho salmon, and rainbow trout have previously been recorded (MoE 2020b; Norris 2020). A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett (2007) report that upper Bulkley coho and steelhead spawn and rear in Ailport Creek. An adjacent landowner noted that in the past, during a high flow event, an adult steelhead was stranded in a pond at the side of the field adjacent to the stream upstream of crossing 197975. Another adjacent landowner reports that historic high flow events in the watershed were likely related to beaver dam failures in the upper reaches of the stream network. DFO (1998), (as cited in McCarthy and Fernando (2015)) reported that crossing 197976 was a barrier at low flows. Following site visits in 2007 and 2017, Wilson and Rabnett (2007) and Smith (2018) reported that the culvert was not an issue for passage. There were no records found of crossing 197975 being assessed for fish passage in the past. Government of British Columbia (2022) records indicate that downstream of 197976 a range tenure is held by 102039220 Saskatchewan Ltd. and that tenure for the first 210m of stream immediately upstream of the highway is registered to Danny Staudt. Additionally, there are multiple other range tenures overlapping Ailport Creek and tributaries further up in the watershed. There are numerous modelled stream crossing locations upstream of 197975 however all crossings on the mainstem appear to be bridges in aerial imagery. PSCIS stream crossings on Ailport Creek were ranked as high priorities for follow up by Irvine (2021) and Mazany-Wright et al.

The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels sub-dominant.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with deep pools dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, undercut banks, overhanging vegetation, and instream vegetation.The average channel width was 7.7m, the average wetted width was 3.5m, and the average gradient was 1%. Although side channels continued to flow throughout the area surveyed, approximately 160m downstream of the crossing the main channel was dewatered below the location of a beaver dam. Areas of riparian and bank degradation from cattle trampling were noted throughout the area surveyed and there was fencing spanning the channel. Large deposits of substrate and clumped large woody debris piles were observed within widened channel areas indicating disturbance and high flow events. There were abundant gravels presetn suitable for spawning resident and anadromous salmonids. Habitat was rated as high value for salmonid rearing and spawning with numerous fish observed and numerous deep pools to 0.95m deep. Stream Characteristics Upstream of 197976 and downstream of 197975 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 197976 for 345m (Figures 5.82 - 5.83). The average channel width was 8.1m, the average wetted width was 4.2m, and the average gradient was 2.2%.The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels sub-dominant.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with deep pools dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation. Fish were observed throughout the area surveyed and extensive algae growth was present on stream substrates. Large woody debris was rare and riparian/bank damage due to livestock was minimal and located at what appeared to be watering sites. Fencing was located across the stream in multiple locations. Patches of gravels suitable for spawning were present. Habitat value was rated as medium as the surveyed area was considered an important migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and having moderate rearing potential. 5.4 Stream Characteristics Upstream of 197975 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 197975 for 550m (Figures 5.84 - 5.85). The average channel width was 7.7m, the average wetted width was 3.5m, and the average gradient was 3%.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with deep pools dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, boulders, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation.The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels sub-dominant. Immediately upstream of the crossing for ~80m, extensive anthropogenic damage was noted due to dredging of the channel. Heavy cattle grazing was also observed on the left bank. Juvenile salmonids were observed occasionally throughout the area surveyed. Fencing was located across the stream approximately 250m upstream of the culvert. Patches of gravels suitable for spawning were present. Habitat value was rated as medium as the surveyed area was considered an important migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and having moderate rearing potential. Fish Sampling Electrofishing was conducted with results summarised in Tables 5.68 - 5.69 and Figure 5.79. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS crossing 197976 with a bridge (12.5m span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at $11,250,000 for a cost benefit of 2.2 linear m/$1000 and 18.1 m2/$1000. As the crossing partially backwaters naturally, a plan to backwater the crossing could also be of consideration in the short term with a rough cost estimate to complete of $25,000. Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS crossing 197975 with a bridge (11.5m span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at $345,000 for a cost benefit of 71.6 linear m/$1000 and 551.1 m2/$1000. Relocation of the driveway accessing the private land from the other side of the stream and removal of the crossing could also be considered. Conclusion There was 24.7km of habitat modelled upstream of crossing 197975 rated as medium value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Crossing 197976 was ranked as a moderate priority for proceeding to design for replacement as it appears to pass fish during most flows. Crossing 197975 was ranked as a moderate priority for proceeding to design for replacement as it appears to likely present a more serious impediment to upstream passage and because implementation of the works can be considered cost effective and logistically less complicated than works on a major highway. As Ailport Creek appears to be a high value fish stream with significant impacts due to culvert maintenance (dredging), adjacent land use (cattle trampled banks and grazed/removed riparian vegetation) and high flow events (potentially beaver dam failure related), it is recommended that a plan be developed to work with adjacent landowners and tenure holders to exclude cattle from the riparian area, implement stream restoration actions and explore possibilities related to progressive beaver management in the watershed. tab_hab_summary %&gt;% filter(Site == my_site | Site == my_site2) %&gt;% # select(-Site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), scroll = F) Table 5.67: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 197976.

The site was located approximately 2km upstream from the confluence with the Nanika River, which flows north west for approximately 10km before draining into Morice Lake. This crossing is the responsibility of Canfor Corporation. Background At crossing 198008, Tributary to Nanika River is a second order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately 1.6km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 1605m to 912m at the crossing (Table 5.74).

The only notable sockeye run in the Morice watershed is the Morice-Nanika sockeye. The Babine watershed sockeye stock makes up 91% of the Skeena watershed escapement, while the Morice-Nanika stock makes up only 1% to 2% on average. This makes the Morice-Nanika stock vulnerable to over harvesting. Sockeye escapement numbers averaged 50,000 in the 1950’s, but numbers have generally been in decline since then and remained low through to 2001. The low nutrient levels in Morice Lake, low spawner recruitment, climate conditions that cause flooding, redd dewatering and freezing, predation, and the availability of quality spawning habitat during high escapement years are thought to be the factors influencing production and possibly contributing to the decline of Morice-Nanika sockeye. The Nanika River also provides the most important rearing habitat for rainbow trout in the Morice watershed (G. Tamblyn and Croft 2003). PSCIS stream crossing 198008 was ranked as a moderate priority for follow up by the Society for Ecosystem Restoration in Northern BC.

The average channel width was 2.3m, the average wetted width was 1.3m, and the average gradient was 5.2%.Total cover amount was rated as abundant with overhanging vegetation dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, and undercut banks.The dominant substrate was gravels with fines sub-dominant. This was a small stream with low, consistent flows and shallow pools. There were few undercut banks but abundant overhanging vegetation. Gravels were present throughout with fines near the bottom half of the survey and more cobbles near the top. The gradient was steeper in the top half of the survey and decreased further downstream. A few functional large woody debris clusters created drops up to 0.6m high. Overall, the habitat was rated as medium value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Stream Characteristics Upstream The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 198008 for 800m (Figures 5.94 - 5.97). The average channel width was 2m, the average wetted width was 0.9m, and the average gradient was 7.5%.The dominant substrate was gravels with cobbles sub-dominant.Total cover amount was rated as abundant with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, and overhanging vegetation. There were multiple channels. The non-dominant channel was most likely surveyed here. The bottom 100m was low gradient, with patches of gravel and good flow for the time of year. Dolly Varden are known to be present upstream. There are no lakes upstream, indicating the stream was passable to Dolly Varden. The habitat was rated as medium value as an important migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and having moderate rearing potential. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS crossing 198008 with a bridge (3m span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at $100,000 for a cost benefit of 0 linear m/$1000 and 0 m2/$1000. Conclusion There was 1km of habitat modelled upstream of crossing 198008 with areas surveyed rated as medium value for salmonid rearing and spawning. 198008 was ranked as a moderate priority for proceeding to design for replacement. Electrofishing upstream and downstream of the culvert is recommended to provide insight into fish community composition and density. Due to low historical numbers of sockeye salmon in the Nanika watershed, it would be important to find out if they are using this tributary for spawning and/or rearing. tab_hab_summary %&gt;% filter(Site == my_site) %&gt;% # select(-Site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), scroll = F) Table 5.77: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 198008.

Thautil River maintains relatively high flows throughout the year until the freeze up occurs, typically in November (G. Tamblyn and Croft 2003). In a stream inventory study of the Thautil watershed conducted by David Bustard and Associates Ltd. (1997) in 1996, it was concluded that steelhead, bull trout, and dolly varden were the three predominant species found in the Thautil River. Steelhead and bull trout were utilizing larger channels with an average gradient less than 6%. Dolly varden were the predominant species in smaller tributaries, and were found in streams with a gradient of up to 13%.

There was low flow through the culvert at the time of survey. It was noted that the boulders found at the outlet could present a barrier to upstream fish migration, depending on life stage and stream flow conditions.

The average channel width was 2m, the average wetted width was 1.2m, and the average gradient was 9%.The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels sub-dominant.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with large woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation. Fish were sighted downstream during the assessment. There was abundant and functional large woody debris, creating cover and deep pools. The gradient increased near the confluence, with large woody debris jams up to 1m in height forming pools approximately 0.45m deep. There appeared to be abundant rearing habitat with suitable overwintering areas. There were patches of gravel found throughout the length surveyed, but the gradient was always greater than 5%, which is not ideal for spawning. Overall, the habitat was rated as medium value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Stream Characteristics Upstream The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 198016 for 625m (Figures 5.100 - 5.103). The average channel width was 1.9m, the average wetted width was 1.5m, and the average gradient was 7%.The dominant substrate was gravels with cobbles sub-dominant.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation. There were sporadic pools and abundant, deep undercut banks. Abundant gravels were present suitable for spawning. Few large and small woody debris steps up to 70cm in height were present. The riparian vegetation consisted primarily of mature spruce trees. The habitat was rated as medium value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS crossing 198016 with a streambed simulation (embedded pipe) (3m diameter) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at $100,000 for a cost benefit of 12 linear m/$1000 and 22.8 m2/$1000. Conclusion Although modelling indicated the stream did not likley contain high value rearing and spawning habitat for anadromous species (due to smaller size and steeper gradients) it was estimated (by measuring in QGIS) that there was approximately 1.2km of habitat upstream of the FSR that is likely fish bearing (less than 12%). Areas surveyed were rated as medium value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Crossing 198016 was ranked as a moderate priority for proceeding to design for replacement. The stream was confirmed as fish bearing during the site visit. Electrofishing upstream and downstream of the culvert is recommended in order to determine species present and associated densities. PIT tagging of fish captured upstream and downstream could also be considered for building an understanding of how the culvert may impact local fish populations as well as provide baseline monitoring should replacement of the crossing occur. tab_hab_summary %&gt;% filter(Site == my_site) %&gt;% # select(-Site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), scroll = F) Table 5.80: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 198016.

The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 1543m to 659m near the crossing (Table 5.81). Upstream of crossing 198048, rainbow trout have previously been recorded (MoE 2020b; Norris 2020). grid::grid.raster(jpeg::readJPEG(&quot;fig/cesford.JPG&quot;)) Figure 5.104: Location of potential location of crossing 198090 which was not present in the field. fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), footnote_text = &#39;Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above&#39;, scroll = F) Table 5.81: Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing 198048.

Although Wilson and Rabnett (2007) recommended establishing a downstream weir and excavating adequate outfall drop pools to facilitate fish passage at crossing 198048, they ranked the site as a moderate priority for remediation due to dewatering below Highway 16. Smith (2018) assessed the site in 2017 and noted that a comparison of photos taken in 2006 and 2017 indicates that a significant amount of gravel has been deposited in the channel below the culvert outlets. Upon review of aerial imagery, it appears that a large portion of the historical paths of Cesford Creek are located with the floodplain of the Bulkley River with extensive impacts apparent due to land clearing and the installation of the railway. The railway in this section of the upper Bulkley River bisects numerous historical meanders blocking access to extensive areas of likely very high value low velocity salmon rearing habitat. In addition there also appears to be ditching within these lands used for agriculture that although unconfirmed, may function to lower the water table in the floodplain, reducing productivity exacerbating seasonal dewatering.

Total cover amount was rated as with overhanging vegetation dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris and undercut banks (Table 5.86). The average channel width was 5.5m, the average wetted width was 1.5m and the average gradient was 3.5%. The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels subdominant. The habitat was rated as medium value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Stream Characteristics Upstream of 198048 and downstream of 198049 The stream was surveyed immediately upstream from 198048 for approximately 675m (Figures 5.107 - 5.108). Within the area surveyed, total cover amount was rated as with deep pools dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, and overhanging vegetation (Table 5.86). The average channel width was 5.1m, the average wetted width was 3.3m and the average gradient was 2.8%. The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels subdominant. Habitat value was rated as medium value for resident salmonid rearing and spawning. Stream Characteristics Upstream of 198048 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 198049 for 600m (Figures 5.109 - 5.110). The dominant substrate was cobbles with boulders sub-dominant.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with dominant. Cover was also present as .The average channel width was 5m, the average wetted width was 2.8m, and the average gradient was 2.1%. The stream had good flow and moderate complexity due to mature cottonwood riparian and frequent large woody debris. Occasional pool and frequent gravel sections were also noted. Habitat value was rated as medium as the surveyed area was considered an important migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and having moderate rearing potential. Cesford Creek was also surveyed approximately 950m upstream from 198049 for a distance of approximately 500m. The average channel width was 4.3m, the average wetted width was 1.9m, and the average gradient was 4.2%.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with dominant. Cover was also present as .The dominant substrate was NA with NA sub-dominant. Habitat value was rated as medium with moderate value habitat for salmonid rearing and occasional pockets of gravel suitable for salmonid spawning. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS crossing 198048 with a bridge (10m span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at $9,000,000 for a cost benefit of 1.2 linear m/$1000 and 6.1 m2/$1000. Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS crossing 198049 with a bridge (10m span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at $9,000,000 for a cost benefit of 1.1 linear m/$1000 and 5.6 m2/$1000. Relocation of the driveway accessing the private land from the other side of the stream and removal of the crossing could also be considered. For PSCIS crossing 198090 it is recommended some sort of fish passable structure be installed under the railway to reconnect Cesford Creek with the Bulkley River. The cost of the work is roughly estimated at $9,000,000. Conclusion Management of connectivity within Cesford Creek would be most appropriately managed on the watershed level beginning with re-connection of the stream under the railway in the vicinity of the location of PSCIS 198090. Without re-connection at the railway, the stream cannot provide habitat for species other than the rainbow trout documented as resident. A large portion of the historical paths of Cesford Creek are located with the floodplain of the Bulkley River with extensive impacts apparent due to land clearing and the installation of the railway which bisects numerous historical upper Bulkley River meanders. In addition there also appears to be ditching within these lands used for agriculture that although unconfirmed, may function to lower the water table in the floodplain. It is recommended that a plan be developed in conjunction with CN Rail, adjacent landowners, First Nations regulators and local stewardship groups to reconnect the channel at the railway, exclude cattle from the riparian area, implement stream restoration actions and explore possibilities related to progressive beaver management in the watershed.

This site was located on a spur road, approximately 150m upstream from the confluence with the Lamprey Creek. This crossing is the responsibility of Canfor Corporation. Background At crossing 198064, Tributary to Lamprey Creek is a second order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately 4.8km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 1221m to 763m near the crossing (Table 5.87).

Low flows restrict the availability of areas suitable for steelhead rearing. Significant sediment depositions into the Lamprey watershed have been caused by poor logging and road building practises. Other species that have been previously recorded in Lamprey Creek include lake chub, longnose sucker, longnose dace, and prickly sculpin (G. Tamblyn and Croft 2003). In 2002, large numbers of pacific lamprey were spotted spawning in Lamprey Creek during the months of June and July (Bustard and Schell 2002). Although there are six modelled crossings located upstream of PSCIS crossing 198064 none are on portions of stream modelled as accessible (&lt;20%). PSCIS crossing 198064 was ranked as a moderate priority for follow up by the Society for Ecosystem Restoration in Northern BC due to field notes passed on from Lars Reese Hanson (WLRS - Ecosystems Biologist).

Stream Characteristics at Crossing At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing 198064 was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011b) (Table 5.89). Fish up to 150mm long were spotted near the crossing. Water temperature was 9\\(^\\circ\\)C, pH was 8.2 and conductivity was 357uS/cm. The stream had comparatively good flow for smaller tributaries the greater Lamprey Creek watershed and review of Phase 1 assessment information indicated that the majority of Lamprey Creek tributaries assessed for fish passage during the same time period this site was assessed were dry. fpr::fpr_table_cv_summary_memo() Table 5.89: Summary of fish passage assessment for PSCIS crossing 198064.

Cover was also present as large woody debris, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation. Abundant undercut banks were present, but few deep pools. Water flowed beneath the substrate approximately 5m from the confluence with Lamprey creek. The habitat was rated as medium value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Stream Characteristics Upstream The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 198064 for 500m (Figures 5.113 - 5.116). The dominant substrate was gravels with cobbles sub-dominant.The average channel width was 2.8m, the average wetted width was 1.9m, and the average gradient was 4.2%.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, and overhanging vegetation. There were abundant patches of gravel that would be suitable for coho spawning at higher flows. Abundant undercut banks were present that provided cover for fish, but there were very few deep pools. The habitat was rated as medium value, containing suitable spawning habitat and having moderate rearing potential. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS crossing 198064 with a bridge (10m span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at $300,000 for a cost benefit of 6 linear m/$1000 and 16.8 m2/$1000. Conclusion There was 1.8km of habitat modelled upstream of crossing 198064 with areas surveyed rated as medium value for salmonid rearing and spawning. 198064 was tentatively ranked as a moderate priority for proceeding to design for replacement. Although a smaller system, assessment data indicates that this stream had comparatively good flow for a smaller tributary in the greater Lamprey Creek watershed. Electrofishing upstream and downstream of the culvert could be considered in order to determine all species present and associated densities. PIT tagging of fish captured upstream and downstream could also be considered for building an understanding of how the culvert may impact local fish populations as well as provide baseline monitoring data should replacement of the crossing occur. tab_hab_summary %&gt;% filter(Site == my_site) %&gt;% # select(-Site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), scroll = F) Table 5.90: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 198064.

Crossing 198066 was located on a small private road, approximatley 0.1km upstream from the confluence with a side channel of the Bulkley River. Crossing 123377 was located on Walcott Road 2.4km upstream of the confluence with the Bukley River, and 123375 was located on Highway 16 approximately 1.7km upstream of Walcott Road. Crossing 198066 was on private land owned by Jeremy Rouw with hay fields as well as Udder View Dairy Farm located upstream of the crossing. Crossings 123377 and 123375 are the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure and have chris_culvert_ids of 2078026 and 123375 respectively. Upstream of Highway 16 approximately 4.6km, PSCIS culverts 123382 are located on the Thompson Creek mainstem on McNeil Road adjacent to private land. On the mainstem, a further 2.5km upstream and 375m downstream of Fishpan Lake a bridge (PSCIS 123383) is located on an unnamed road. Background At crossing 198066, Thompson Creek is a fourth order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately 43.1km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 1623m to 596m near the crossing (Table 5.91). Upstream of crossing 198066, cutthroat trout, coastal cutthroat trout, coho salmon, rainbow trout, and dolly varden have previously been recorded (MoE 2020b; Norris 2020). A total of 38ha of lake and 44ha of wetland are modelled upstream. This includes the 12.2ha Fishpan Lake, which drains into Thompson Creek. It is important to note that freshwater atlas mapping of the Thompson Creek drainage is not correct. Although in the freshwater atlas, the Thompson Creek mainstem is mapped incorrectly as flowing under the highway at PSCIS crossing 123375, the majority of flow from Thompson Creek actually drains under Highway 16 through an open bottomed structure (PSCIS 123376) located approximately 925m to the north of Highway 16 culvert 123375. G. Tamblyn and Jessop (2000) have documented detailed fish habitat, riparian and channel assessment data for Reach 1 and 2 of the stream surveying 12.6km along with an impact synopsis and restoration suggestions. Landowners adjacent to the stream at crossings 198066 and 123377 reported that Thompson Creek was historically redirected from its original path on the height of land near the Bulkley River within the last 100 years. The historic dominant stream path was reported as flowing towards the Bulkley River in a north-eastern direction after emerging from the Thompson Creek valley outlet. At the time of 2021 and 2022 surveys, the channel flowed from the valley outlet to an oxbow of the Bulkley River within two separate paths that flowed initially in south and south-east directions, and then in a primarily western direction. These channels appeared to terminate within excavated trenched areas cut to help drain the hay field adjacent to the stream. The landowner noted that fish stranding has been observed within the western most excavated channel. Figure 5.117 shows a digital elevation model built from lidar available from the BC Government. The model shows there is elevation relief in a northern direction from where the Thompson Creek valley meets the Bulkley River floodplain. Additionally, evidence of extensive machine ditching to prevent the channel from flooding the agricultural fields that are on the floodplain of the Bulkley River as well as potentially to drain the water that may seasonally inundate wetland type areas to the south can be seen in the imagery. Landowners that resided adjacent to the stream and Walcott Road reported that the crossing at Walcott Road had nearly washed out at the road several years ago due to high flows related to beaver dam failures. Crossing 123378 has been recorded as a bridge on Thompson Creek on the BC Hydro powerline between the floodplain of the Bulkley River and Walcott Road (M. C. Gollner and Cain 2014). The landowners adjacent to the stream report this bridge washed out at the time of the beaver dam failure upstream and was replaced by BC Hydro in 2020. In addition to surveys conducted at the three subject culverts in 2021, Thompson creek was re-visited in 2022 with a survey conducted within the wetted channel in a downstream direction from the replaced bridge (crossing 123378) on the BC Hydro powerline to where the stream directs to the south and the agricultural fields begin. Surveyors also walked the north edge of the field towards the Bulkley River for approximately 250m then circled back south through the shrub dominated areas to the hay fields to scope for evidence that a defined historic channel was located in this area. Although some low lying areas were observed, no defined channel was located which is not surprising since this area is all within the floodplain of the Bulkley River, so channels/wetland complexes would historically be present in this area and shift throughout the floodplain based on beaver activity and flows in both Thompson Creek and side channels of the Bulkley River. Following recommendations from the 2022 survey (provided in an initial release of this report), crossing 123377 on Walcott Road was revisited September 14, 2023 and electrofishing was conducted above and below the crossing to gather baseline data. Fish were tagged with Passive Integrated Transponders (PIT tags) to help track movement within the system over time, and to give an indication of whether anadromous species are able to ascend through the agricultural area adjacent to the Bulkley River floodplain. Results from this survey are now included in this updated report. fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %&gt;% select(-`Elev Min`) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), footnote_text = &#39;Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above&#39;, scroll = F) Table 5.91: Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing 198066.

PSCIS stream crossing 123377 was ranked as a high priority for follow up by Irvine (2018) and Smith (2018) because of the relatively large size of the stream and habitat rated as high value in PSCIS (Table 5.92.

Stream Characteristics at Crossings Although, at the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing 198066 on the private road near the Bulkley River was 95% backwatered and appeared passable to all life stages and species, it was un-embedded and ranked as a potential barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011b). There was rip rap placed around the culvert inlets and outlets (Table 5.93). PSCIS crossing 123377 on Walcott Road was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage (Table 5.94). Water temperature was 13\\(^\\circ\\)C, pH was 8.2 and conductivity was 294uS/cm. PSCIS crossing 123375 on Highway 16 was un-embedded, 50% backwatered and ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage (Table 5.95). fpr::fpr_table_cv_summary_memo() Table 5.93: Summary of fish passage assessment for PSCIS crossing 198066.

Total cover amount was rated as moderate with overhanging vegetation dominant (Table 5.96). The average channel width was 3.4m, the average wetted width was 2.5m and the average gradient was 1.8%. The dominant substrate was gravels with fines subdominant. The habitat was rated as high value for salmonid rearing and spawning. This area is an important migration corridor, a likely area of refuge during high flows and valuable juvenile rearing area that connects Thompson Creek to a side channel of the Bulkley River. Hundreds of fish were spotted that ranged from 40 - 80mm in length. Stream Characteristics Upstream of 198066 and downstream of 123377 The stream was initially surveyed in 2021 from immediately upstream from 198066 for approximately 350m (Figures 5.122 - 5.123). Within the area surveyed, total cover amount was rated as moderate with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as deep pools and overhanging vegetation (Table 5.96). The average channel width was 2.8m, the average wetted width was 2.1m and the average gradient was 0.5%. The eastern channel was primarily dry when surveyed in 2021, with fines substrates, and a poorly defined channel due to the wetland type character of the area. In addition to the eastern channel which was oriented in an east-west direction, the western channel, oriented north-south just upstream of the crossing, was also surveyed for 200m. At the time of the survey, this western channel contained the majority of flow for the watershed and was comprised of a 4 foot wide channel with reed canary grass on either side, fine substrate and no complexity. The landowner reports that this channel was excavated within the hay field in order to prevent inundation of the field by water from Thompson Creek. During field assessments in 2021 it was also noted that there was significant clearing of mature cottonwood forest adjacent to the side channel of the Bulkley River south of culvert 198066 on the private farm road. Habitat value was rated as medium value for resident salmonid rearing and spawning as the area was considered an important corridor but had lower rearing values due to the lack of complexity in the excavated main flowing drainage. This site was revisited in 2022. Surveyors walked downstream from the bridge (crossing 123378) and then west along the historic channel for a total of approximately 450m (Figures 5.126 - 5.127). The dominant substrate was gravels with cobbles sub-dominant.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation.The average channel width was 5.2m, the average wetted width was 2.8m, and the average gradient was 2.5%. Abundant gravels were present suitable for spawning resident and anadromous species. Few deep pools were present suitable for juvenile rearing and overwintering with some evidence of large flow events likely due to beaver dam blowouts upstream (which have been reported by adjacent landowners). Habitat value was rated as medium value for resident salmonid rearing and spawning. The area was also surveyed by drone presented in Figures 5.118 - 5.119. The section downstream of 123377 was surveyed for approximately 484m. The average channel width was 4.3m, the average wetted width was 2.7m, and the average gradient was 2.9%.The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels sub-dominant.Total cover amount was rated as abundant with deep pools dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation. There were abundant quantities of deep pools throughout the area surveyed with periodic small and large woody debris jams present up to 1.3m in height. Numerous juvenile fish were observed throughout the area surveyed. There was one site noted with significant bank erosion, a small walking trail bridge and a water intake observed. Overall the habitat was considered complex and ranked as high value with good flow and abundant fish present. The landowner adjacent to the stream on the downstream side of Walcott Road noted that there is another bridge located on his land downstream of the area surveyed. model_url &lt;- &#39;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.mapsmadeeasy.com/maps/public/f2c9a83f405c4672bde09b05d0462f61&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; title=&quot;Maps Made Easy&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; frameBorder =&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#39; knitr::asis_output(model_url) my_photo = &#39;fig/pixel.png&#39; my_caption = paste0(&#39;Orthomosaic of habitat upstream of PSCIS crossing 198066.&#39;) knitr::include_graphics(my_photo, dpi = NA) Figure 5.118: Orthomosaic of habitat upstream of PSCIS crossing 198066. model_url &lt;- &#39;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.mapsmadeeasy.com/maps/public_3D/f2c9a83f405c4672bde09b05d0462f61&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; title=&quot;Maps Made Easy&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; frameBorder =&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#39; knitr::asis_output(model_url) my_photo = &#39;fig/pixel.png&#39; my_caption = paste0(&#39;3D model of habitat upstream of PSCIS crossing 198066.

Stream Characteristics Upstream of 123377 and downstream of 123375 The stream was surveyed upstream of 123377 for approximately 450m. Total cover amount was rated as abundant with deep pools dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation.The dominant substrate was gravels with cobbles sub-dominant.The average channel width was 4.8m, the average wetted width was 3.4m, and the average gradient was 2.7%. There were frequent deep pools up to 80cm and abundant large woody debris and gravels. There was a narrow strip of mature cottonwood riparian immediately upstream of Walcott Road with the channel hard to locate upstream of confluence with the mainstem that flows under the open bottom structure due to low flows and the presence of reed canary grass and willow dominated vegetation. PSCIS crossing 123376 on Highway 16 was assessed by M. C. Gollner, Cain, and Russell (2013) in 2013. This is an open bottom structure (pipe arch) located approximately 600m upstream of Walcott Road and 925m north of PSCIS crossing 123375 on Highway 16. As noted, the majority of discharge within the Thompson Creek watershed flows through this crossing with the freshwater atlas not capturing the connectivity between this area and the mainstem mapped to the east of the Highway closed bottom structure (PSCIS 123375 and MojTi ID 2076608). This open bottom structure appears to have been installed within the last 15 years and was considered passable to all life stages at the time of both the 2013 and 2021 surveys. The structure was 7m in diameter and 24m in length. The site at crossing 123376 was revisited in 2021, with photos shown in Figures 5.132 - 5.133. A digital elevation model of the area surrounding crossings 123377 and 123376 is presented in Figure 5.120. Note that this imagery was taken from the LiDAR BC open data portal here and there was no lidar available for areas of the Thompson Creek watershed located south east of crossing 123380 on Highway 16. Review of this lidar imagery for areas between Walcott Road to areas upstream of highway 16 show extensive anthropogenic excavations upstream of 123375 likely draining large areas of low lying wetlands to accommodate agricultural fields. Crossing 123375 located further upstream on the highway was surveyed in a downstream direction for 50m. the average channel width was 2.8m, the average wetted width was 1.5m and the average gradient was 1.5%. The stream flow was low, and the vegetation was predominantly grass, shrubs and young deciduous trees. Substrate was predominantly fines. Habitat value was rated as low at the time of the survey there was no habitat present suitable for rearing or spawning. Multiple ditch lines transect the area upstream of crossing 123376 on Highway 16 beginning approximately 175m to the west of bridge crossing 123379 and ending just upstream of 123375. Crossings 123381 and 123380 located 500m upstream of highway crossing 123375 were not accessible by surveyors because they were on private land and blocked behind gates however, these sites likely do not have significant influence on connectivity in the watershed because the main body of the stream flows to the north through open bottom crossing 123376. Located approximately 3.5km upstream of 123380 and 3km below the outlet of Fishpan Lake, PSCIS crossing 123382 was also visited (Figures 5.134 - 5.135). There was minimal flow with much of the riparian vegetation removed and clear evidence of cattle trampled banks upstream and downstream. There was private land on both sides of the road. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/lidar_123377_thompson_walcott_us.png&quot;) Figure 5.120: Digital elevation model of Thompson Creek upstream of Walcott Road and Highway 16. Note that the majority of discharge for the system flows under Highway 16 at an open bottom structure (PSCIS 123376) located approximatley 925m to the north of where the main channel is incorrectly mapped in the freshwater atlas (PSCIS 123375). Also, note the extensive excavation of ditches draining the areas east of the highway adjacent to 123375. Stream Characteristics Upstream of 123375 This section was surveyed upstream of 123375 for approximately 100m. The dominant substrate in this area was fines, the average channel width was 1.7m, the average wetted width was 1.9m and the average gradient was 0.7%. The habitat value was ranked as low as there was very little flow and because the stream was heavily impacted by cattle. Fish Sampling As noted above - following recommendations from the 2022 survey, crossing 123377 was revisited on September 14, 2023 and electrofishing was conducted with results summarised in Tables 5.97 - 5.98 and Figure 5.121. A total of 35 fish were captured upstream, and 24 fish were captured downstream. Species caught included coho, rainbow trout, and dolly varden (Figures 5.130 - 5.131). All fish captured with a fork length greater than 60mm were tagged with Passive Integrated Transponders (PIT tags) with data stored here. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate As crossing 198066 did not appear to be a significant barrier to fish passage at the time of the survey, and because of anthroprogenic alterations upstream (dredging and ditching) - replacement of the culvert on the private Udder View Dairy farm road was not recommended at least untill a plan to improve watershed health in the agricultural area immediately upstream was devise. Replacement of PSCIS crossing 123377 on Walcott Road with a bridge (10m span) is recommended with the cost of the work is estimated at $2,400,000 for a cost benefit of 5.1 linear m/$1000 and 24.6 m2/$1000. At the time of reporting, remediation of replacement of PSCIS crossing 123375 on Highway 16 is not recommended as the areas immediately upstream and downstream of the crossing do not contain suitable habitat. The main flow of Thompson Creek flows to the east and north of this crossing and passes under the highway through the open bottomed crossing located at PSCIS crossing 1233376. Efforts to remediate fish passage in the watershed can be focused on crossing structures on this mainstem such as PSCIS crossing 123377 on Walcott Road and potentially on PSCIS crossing 123382 located upstream of the highway on McNeil Road. Conclusion Although PSCIS culvert 198066 on the private Udder View Dairy farm road ranks as a potential barrier according to the conservative provincial metric is was considered passable to all life stages and species at the time of surveying in 2021. Additionally, although velocities within the pipe may prevent passage at some times of year it is recommended that options to remove the culvert completely be explored before replacement is considered. As review of lidar data indicates there is appropriate elevation relief for the stream to travel naturally in a northern direction where the Thompson Creek valley meets the Bulkley River floodplain (as has been reported as historically occurring), it seems feasible that regulators, First Nations and other organizations could work with the landowner to develop a plan to redirect some or all stream discharge to the north and infill the drainage ditches east of the culvert. It is also recommended that as part of that plan, agricultural area could be removed from sections of the Bulkley River floodplain to allow for retention of water within wetland complexes and the regeneration of riparian shrub and forest communities adjacent to Thompson Creek and the Bukley River. The feasibility of providing financial incentives for the landowner to reduce the area of agriculture and increase wetland assets on the property could be explored. Regardless, for now, hardening of the road/culvert infrastructure at PSCIS culvert 198066 and the anthropogenic drainage network upstream of the private road should not be pursued as this section of stream at the time of the survey was not in a healthy state and this will not be addressed through those actions. Investigation of fish presence upstream near Walcott Road (discussed in more detail below) would give a good indication of whether the situation on the floodplain is preventing anadromous species such as coho from accessing further up in the watershed. There was 14.7km of habitat modelled upstream of Walcott Road as having high intrinsic potential for steelhead. Habitat in areas surveyed was rated as medium value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Electrofishing above and below crossing 123377 and tagging with Passive Integrated Transponders (PIT tags) was conducted in 2023 to track the movement of fish in the system over time. This baseline sampling has improved our state of knowledge regarding fish presence in the watershed as well as regarding the severity of the culvert in terms of fish passage as some life stages of coho are able to ascend not only through the agricultural area adjacent to the Bulkley River floodplain but also to above Walcott Road. As all fish over 60mm were tagged with PIT tags, their health and movement can be tracked over time with results available to inform effectiveness monitoring should restoration actions be completed. The crossing ranked as a high priority for proceeding to design for replacement. At the time of reporting updates (June 2024) geotechnical investigations had been conducted (by contractors of Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure) to inform the design of a replacement structure. Culvert 123375 on Highway 16 was ranked as a low priority due to low flow, its low habitat value and the fact that the main flow of Thompson Creek is actually through the open bottom structure at crossing 123376. Field assessments indicate that the stream is unlikley to provide any fish habitat due to annual dewatering, extensive cattle damage and a lack of scoured streambed. Review of lidar imagery indicates extensive excavation of ditches draining areas east of the highway adjacent to 123375 to accommodate the Thompson Creek ranch and this may provide most of the flow for this small tributary. Again it is noted that this steam is not mapped correctly in the freshwater atlas at this location and the main channel of Thompson Creek flows to the east and north of this crossing and passes under the highway through the open bottomed crossing located at PSCIS crossing 1233376. It is recommended that a detailed habitat confirmation be assessed upstream and downstream of PSCIS crossing 123382 located on McNeil Road to gather information about the likelihood that the culvert is blocking fish from upstream migration and provide data regarding habitat quantity and quality as well as fisheries information. Permission from the adjacent landowner will likely be required as the area upstream and downstream of McNeil Road was behind cattle fences. Restoration suggestions by G. Tamblyn and Jessop (2000) can still be considered relevant for all areas of the Thompson Creek watershed and include working with landowners to limit cattle access to the riparian zone, re-establishing riparian vegetation, improving cattle crossings and fish passage at roads. tab_hab_summary %&gt;% filter(Site == my_site | Site == my_site2 | Site == my_site3) %&gt;% # select(-Site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;, &#39;, my_site2, &#39; and &#39;, my_site3, &#39;.&#39;), scroll = F) Table 5.96: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 198066, 123377 and 123375.
