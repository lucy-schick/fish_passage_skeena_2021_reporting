## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`. The site is located on a spur road.

<br>

## Background {.unnumbered}

At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a
watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_min')`m near the crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-198064)). Upstream of crossing
`r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp()` have previously
been recorded [@moe2020KnownBC; @norris2022smnorrisbcfishobs].

```{r tab-wshd-198064, eval = T}
fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %>% 
  fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0('Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing ', my_site, '.'),
           footnote_text = 'Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above',
           scroll = F)

```

PSCIS stream crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a moderate
priority for follow up by the Society for Ecosystem Restoration in Northern BC. A summary of habitat modelling outputs is presented in Table
\@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-198064). A map of the watershed is provided in
map attachment
[`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet()`).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {.unnumbered}

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was
un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-198064)). Water temperature was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C,
pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'p_h')` and
conductivity was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')`
<!-- `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198064-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198064-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198064-d01))."))` -->
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` Abundant undercut banks were present, but few deep pools. One section located approximately 80m upstream from the confluence has a steep drop into Lamprey creek. Water flowed beneath substrate approximately 5m from the creek. The
habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value for
salmonid rearing and spawning.

## Stream Characteristics Upstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')`
<!-- `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198064-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198064-06)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198064-d02))."))` -->
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` Surveyors indicated that this was the only stream that had water in it at the time. There was abundant patches of gravel that would be suitable for coho spawning at higher flows. Abundant undercut banks were present that provided cover, but few deep pools. The habitat was rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` value, containing suitable spawning habitat and having
moderate rearing potential.

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS
crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with a bridge
(`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m
span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at
\$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')` for a cost
benefit of `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_net)` linear
m/\$1000 and `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_area_net)`
m^2^/\$1000.

<br>

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

There was
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull= upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of
habitat modelled upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with
areas surveyed rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)`
value for salmonid rearing and spawning. `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priority for proceeding to design for replacement.
