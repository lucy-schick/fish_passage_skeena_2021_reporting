## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`, on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)` road. The site was located approximately 1km upstream from the confluence with Owen Creek, which drains the nearby Owen Lake. Information sourced from the provincial [Forest Tenure Road Section Lines](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/forest-tenure-road-section-lines) spatial layer indicates
YLP Woodlands GP Ltd. [@moe2024ForestTenure] is a road tenure holder at the crossing location. YLP Woodlands GP Ltd. is
part of the Yinka Dene Economic Development Limited Partnership (YLP) which is the corporate business arm of the Wet’suwet’en First Nation.

## Background {.unnumbered}

At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a
watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m at the crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-197378)). A total of `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = total_lakereservoir_ha)`ha of lake and `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = total_wetland_ha)`ha of wetland is modelled upstream. Upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp()` have previously been recorded [@moe2020KnownBC; @norris2020bcfishobs]. The nearby Owen Lake is approximately 300ha in size. Historical records of fish in this lake include rainbow trout, burbot, coho, sucker, dolly varden, lake trout, and whitefish. 

<br>

Following the recommendations from the 2022 survey (provided in an initial release of this report) to perform fish sampling, 
crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was revisited September 13, 2023 and electrofishing was conducted above and below the 
crossing to gather baseline fisheries data. Results from the sampling have been incorporated into this now updated version of this report.

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {.unnumbered}

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was
un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-197378)). The pipe was in very rough condition and had collapsed and separated in half which effected water flow into the barrel.  The water temperature was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C,
pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'p_h')` and
conductivity was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

```

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197378-01)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197378-d01))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` There was a high percentage of crown closure, with riparian shrubs but a thin, coniferous forest further upland. There was an numerous pockets of gravels suitable for rainbow and dolly varden spawning. The stream appeared to have stable flows with no notable erosion. Overall, the
habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value for salmonid rearing and spawning. 

## Stream Characteristics Upstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197378-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197378-d01))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` This was a small stream containing multiple beaver influenced wetland areas with dams. The stream was comprised of two seperate channels mapped as converging approximatley 100m upstream of the crossing.  The dominant channel was the stream mapped as furthest north in the freshwater atlas.  It was surveyed in an upstream direction to the location of a beaver influenced wetland.  Several pockets of gravel suitable for resident rainbow and dolly varden spawning were present. Surveyors noted "nice runs" and good flow volume.  The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` value with moderate rearing potential. Surveyors visited the southern channel at a point approximately 350m upstream of the FSR but the stream channel at this location was very small with fine sediment substrate. 

<br>

## Fish Sampling {.unnumbered}

As noted above - following recommendations from the 2022 survey, crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was revisited on September 13, 2023 and electrofishing was conducted upstream and downstream of `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)`.
Results are summarised in Tables \@ref(tab:tab-fish-site-197378) - \@ref(tab:tab-fish-dens-197378) and Figure
\@ref(fig:plot-fish-box-197378). A total of `r tab_fish_summary_2023 %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, '_us')) %>% group_by(site_id) %>% janitor::adorn_totals() %>% filter(site_id == 'Total') %>% pull(count_fish)` rainbow trout were captured upstream, and `r tab_fish_summary_2023 %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, '_ds')) %>% group_by(site_id) %>% janitor::adorn_totals() %>% filter(site_id == 'Total') %>% pull(count_fish)` rainbow trout were captured downstream `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-197378-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-197378-04)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-197378-d02))."))` All fish captured with a fork length greater than 60mm were tagged with Passive Integrated Transponders (PIT tags) with data stored [here](`r paste0(params$repo_url, "blob/main/data/2023/habitat_confirmations.xls")`).

<br>

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS
crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with a bridge
(`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m
span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at
\$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')` for a cost
benefit of `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_net)` linear
m/\$1000 and `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_area_net)`
m^2^/\$1000.

<br>

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

There was `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull= upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of habitat modelled upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` modelled as highing high intrinsic value for steelhead based on gradient and width.  Areas surveyed
were rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)` value for salmonid rearing 
with large areas of wetland present. The culvert pipe was noted as in very poor condition with the structure near complete
collapse. Although fish sampling within small areas upstream and downstream of the crossing in 2023 resulted in the capture 
of rainbow trout only, other species such as coho utilizing the mainstem of Owen Creek may have accessed this area historically.  

<br>

The Office of Wet'suwet'en has initiated watershed level Nation led recovery/restoration planning for the greater Bii Wenii Kwa (Owen Creek) watershed which includes restoration of this site as a project priority consideration. As the Yinka Dene Economic Development Limited Partnership is noted as a road tenure holder at the location of the site, there could be opportunities for 
collaboration between the two groups related to restoration or removal of the crossing. Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priority for proceeding to design for replacement.
