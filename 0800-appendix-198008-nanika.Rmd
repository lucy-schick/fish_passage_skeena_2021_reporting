## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`, on a spur. The site was located approximately 2km upstream from the confluence with the Nanika River, which flows north west for approximately 10km before draining into Morice Lake. 

<br>

## Background {.unnumbered}

At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a
watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_min')`m near the crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-198008)). At the time of reporting, there was no fisheries information for areas upstream of crossing
`r as.character(my_site)`.

<br>

```{r tab-wshd-198008, eval = T}
fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %>% 
  fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0('Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing ', my_site, '.'),
           footnote_text = 'Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above',
           scroll = F)

```

PSCIS stream crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a moderate
priority for follow up by the Society for Ecosystem Restoration in Northern BC. A summary of habitat modelling outputs is presented in Table
\@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-198008). A map of the watershed is provided in
map attachment
[`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet()`).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {.unnumbered}

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was
un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-198008)). There
was low flow through the culvert at the time of survey. Water temperature was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C,
pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'p_h')` and
conductivity was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')`
<!-- `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198008-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198008-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198008-d01))."))` -->
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` This was a small stream with low, consistent flows and shallow pools. There were few undercut banks but abundant overhanging vegetation. Gravels were present throughout with fines near the bottom half of the survey and more cobbles near the top. The gradient was steeper in the top half of the survey and decreased further downstream. A few functional large woody debris created drops up to 0.6m high. Overall, the
habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value for
salmonid rearing and spawning. 

## Stream Characteristics Upstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')`
<!-- `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198008-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198008-06)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198008-d02))."))` -->
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` There were multiple channels. The non-dominant channel was most likely surveyed here. The bottom 100m is low gradient, with patches of gravel and good flow for the time of year. Dolly Varden are known to be present upstream. There are no lakes upstream, indicating the stream is passable to Dolly Varden. The habitat was rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` value as an important
migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and having
moderate rearing potential.

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS
crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with a bridge
(`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m
span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at
\$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')` for a cost
benefit of `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_net)` linear
m/\$1000 and `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_area_net)`
m^2^/\$1000.

<br>

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

There was
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull= upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of
habitat modelled upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with
areas surveyed rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)`
value for salmonid rearing and spawning. `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priority for proceeding to design for replacement.
